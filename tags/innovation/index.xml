They power Amazon’s product recommendations. They classify documents relevant for a lawsuit. They enable computers to play chess like the masters.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As machine learning applications expand to influence our civic, professional and private lives, it’s important that we all have a basic understanding of how they work and what potential they offer. &lt;a href=&#34;https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/&#34;&gt;Pedro Domingos&lt;/a&gt; undertook the challenge of providing the first comprehensive, nontechnical overview of machine learning in his new book, &lt;i&gt;The Master Algorithm&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Master Algorithm, &lt;/i&gt;Domingos divides the field into five different “tribes” &amp;ndash; symbolism, connectionism (neural networks), evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian networks, and analogical reasoning &amp;ndash; which he challenges his readers to unify in one future “master algorithm” capable of learning nearly anything. This will towards universality informs his book’s bold central hypothesis: “all knowledge - past, present, and future - can be derived from data by a single, universal learning algorithm.” It’s up to us to find it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had the pleasure of interviewing Domingos last week. Keep reading to see the highlights. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Last week, Hilary, Fast Forward Labs founder and CEO, gave the opening keynote at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in Houston, TX. Her talk inspired an audience of over 12,000 women to embrace the unimaginable possibilities that will shape the careers of future technologists. Sure, aspiring engineers and data scientists have to endure the angst that they can no longer chart their future by emulating role models from their past.</description>

      <description>We like to hold fast to the myth of the individual creative genius as the source of the world’s most impactful scientific revolutions or disruptive innovations. But it’s consoling to recall how Isaac Newton consoled his rival Robert Hooke: “If I’ve seen further than others, it was by standing on the shoulders of giants.”
 This is French how painter Nicolas Poussin represents Cedalion providing sight to the blind Orion, a mythological pair associated with each generation’s progress over its predecessors.</description>
