      <description>This week, we had the pleasure of hosting an online talk with the team from Agolo, an NYC-based startup with a great product that automatically summarizes articles (and can even generate new titles for a group of summarized articles). During the event, we discussed:
why summarization has suddenly become interestinghow different industries are applying the technologyhow algorithms work (LDA, word2vec, and recurrent neural networks)related applications (realtime translation, speech recognition)what’s next in the fieldCheck out the recording below!</description>

      <description>We’re excited for tomorrow’s online discussion about automatic text summarization! You can register here. During the event, Mohamed AlTantawy, CTO of Agolo, will explain the tech behind their summarization tool. In this blog post, he describes how his team evaluates the quality of summaries produced by their system. Join us tomorrow to learn more and ask questions about the approach! Evaluating the quality of algorithmically created summaries is a very hard task.</description>

      <title>Making a Case for Machine Learning to Legal Departments</title>

      <description>Since we released our text summarization resources, the legal technology community has shown interest in leveraging summarization technology to support litigation document review, deposition digests, and contract analysis. Data scientist interest to use machine learning to mine legal document corpuses and support legal strategy was also one factor motivating our summarization research. The time is therefore ripe for data scientists to apply new text analytics capabilities for legal use cases.</description>

      <title>Summarization as a Gateway to Computable Language</title>

      <description>Analyzing unstructured text data such as news, emails, chats, narrative prose, legal documents, or transcribed speech is an extremely tough problem. Thanks to massive leaps in data engineering, we can just about store and retrieve this torrent of information. But we can&amp;rsquo;t yet conduct the kind of rich and fast analyses that we take for granted with structured, quantitative data.
Our newly released summarization report is a response to this problem in two senses.</description>

      <title>H.P. Luhn and the Heuristic Value of Simplicity</title>

      <description>&lt;figure data-orig-width=&#34;600&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;385&#34; class=&#34;tmblr-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://68.media.tumblr.com/8ad092dc44ae1ad68bad697a55274b30/tumblr_inline_o4lon7By6N1ta78fg_540.gif&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-orig-width=&#34;600&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;385&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fast Forward Labs team is putting final touches on our &lt;i&gt;Summarization &lt;/i&gt;research, which explains approaches to making text quantifiable and computable. Stay tuned for a series of resources on the topic, including an online talk May 24 where we’ll cover technical details and survey use cases for financial services, media, and professional services with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.agolo.com/&#34;&gt;Agolo&lt;/a&gt;. Sign up &lt;a href=&#34;https://textsummarizationwebinar.splashthat.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In writing our reports, we try not only to inform readers about the libraries, math, and techniques they can use to put a system into production today, but also the lessons they can learn from historical approaches to a given topic. Turning a retrospective eye towards past work can be particularly helpful when using an algorithm like a &lt;a href=&#34;http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/&#34;&gt;recurrent neural network&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because neural networks are notoriously hard to interpret: feature engineering is left to the algorithm, and involves a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2015/09/24/how-do-neural-networks-learn.html&#34;&gt;complex interplay&lt;/a&gt; between the weight of individual computing nodes and the connections that link them together. In the face of this complexity, it can be helpful to keep former, more simple techniques in mind as a heuristic guide - or model - to shape our intuition about how contemporary algorithms work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, we found that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Peter_Luhn&#34;&gt;H.P. Luhn&lt;/a&gt;’s 1958 paper &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i256/f06/papers/luhn58.pdf&#34;&gt;The Automatic Creation of Literary Abstracts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;provided a simple heuristic to help wrap our heads around the basic steps that go into probabilistic models for summarizing text. (For those interested in history, Luhn also wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://altaplana.com/ibmrd0204H.pdf&#34;&gt;a paper about business intelligence&lt;/a&gt; in 1958 that feels like it could have been written today, as it highlights the growing need to automate information retrieval to manage an unwieldy amount of information.) Our design lead, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GrantCuster&#34;&gt;Grant Custer&lt;/a&gt;, designed a prototype you can play with to walk through Luhn’s method. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/luhn/&#34;&gt;Here’s the link&lt;/a&gt; to access the live demo. Feel free to use the suggested text, or to play around your own (and share results on Twitter!). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
