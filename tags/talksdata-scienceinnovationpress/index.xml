      <description>On March 25, 1909, Wilbur Wright (of the Wright brothers) told a reporter at the Cairo, Illinois bulletin that “no airship will ever fly from New York to Paris.” As with most quotes inherited from the past, people often misinterpret Wright’s quote as reactionary because they read it out of context. He continues: “What limits the flight is the motor. No known motor can run at the requisite speed for four days without stopping, and you can’t be sure of finding the proper winds for soaring&amp;hellip;But the history of civilization has usually shown that every new invention has brought in its train new needs it can satisfy, and so what the airship will eventually be used for is probably what we can least predict at the present.</description>
