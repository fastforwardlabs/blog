      <description>&lt;figure data-orig-width=&#34;694&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;376&#34; class=&#34;tmblr-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://68.media.tumblr.com/993f6c53159f5715d9c127b790bb4bf5/tumblr_inline_nz3b9rPB5w1ta78fg_540.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-orig-width=&#34;694&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;376&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 16, 2015, Lyst, an online fashion marketplace based in the United Kingdom, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lyst-ad-campaign-fashion-meets-data-science-flavia-young&#34;&gt;launched its first advertising campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Featuring a series of ironic headlines (one simply says “Rip-off”) etched over beautiful images, the campaign emphasizes the company’s identity as a “challenger brand,” whose success “has been driven by marrying insights from data science with the emotional nature of fashion.” (CEO Chris Morton) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lyst.com&#34;&gt;Lyst&lt;/a&gt; provides fashion consumers with a central platform where they can mix and match millions of products from 11,500 different brands. In this context, data science serves as a virtual personal shopper, recommending products to users based upon insights from their behavior using the site. One might think these recommendations are powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering&#34;&gt;collaborative filtering&lt;/a&gt;, but the world of fashion is far too transient and fickle to support data models matching similar users. Matrices are sparse and inventory drains rapidly (consider flash sales sites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gilt.com/&#34;&gt;Gilt&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, recommendation algorithms align consumer behavior with product features. And as the world of fashion is one dominated by image and appearance, fashion data science has a lot to do with image analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We interviewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ejlbell&#34;&gt;Eddie Bell&lt;/a&gt;, Lyst’s lead data scientist, about his team’s current efforts to use deep learning to analyze images and personalize recommendations to consumers. We talked about his past, his team’s present, and the fashion industry’s future. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Retail: Consumer Privacy Implications</title>

      <description>&lt;figure data-orig-width=&#34;1401&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;956&#34; class=&#34;tmblr-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://68.media.tumblr.com/7404e8cb508c2bc469e5a9887f5ac5e4/tumblr_inline_nvgbviEbKS1ta78fg_540.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-orig-width=&#34;1401&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;956&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2015/08/19/machine-learning-applications-in-fashion-retail.html&#34;&gt;last retail post&lt;/a&gt;, we explained how emerging sensor technologies are changing data science for brick and mortar. Many companies are working to retro-fit physical stores with capabilities originally developed for ecommerce. Without adding any new sensors or tags, image recognition company &lt;a href=&#34;https://blippar.com/en/&#34;&gt;Blippar &lt;/a&gt;provides APIs that digitize physical products to create an in-app experience around them. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/bof-exclusive/farfetch-e-commerce-fashion-brands-omnichannel&#34;&gt;Farfetch&lt;/a&gt;, which initially brought an exclusive network of luxury brick &amp;amp; mortar shops online, recently announced that it will soon provide in-store analytics.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, digital companies continue to seek out physical spaces to augment their customer experience. Warby Parker and Rent the Runway have physical stores, and Gilt and Etsy are exploring new models to engage consumers offline (Gilt has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://fashionista.com/2015/08/gilt-by-appointment&#34;&gt;private retail space&lt;/a&gt; in their corporate headquarters and Etsy &lt;a href=&#34;http://venturebeat.com/2015/08/25/etsy-squeezes-into-brick-and-mortar-stores-with-latest-shop-local-feature/&#34;&gt;launched an app&lt;/a&gt; to inform shoppers of sellers’ nearby products). These digital companies were built upon testing &lt;a href=&#34;http://pathtoperf.com/2015/04/07/01-with-lara-hogan.html&#34;&gt;every detail&lt;/a&gt; affecting their website performance. As tracking migrates to physical retail, it’s important that retailers consider the consumer experience risks associated with new technologies as they explore the benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you look at something on the web, you get ads that pop up and follow you around - companies like that have much better advantage over brick-and-mortar retailers, and so they&amp;rsquo;re under more pressure to equalise the playing field.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/oct/03/analytics-amazon-retailers-physical-cookies-high-street&#34;&gt;Kevin Kearns&lt;/a&gt;, ShopperTrak&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Applications in Fashion Retail</title>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;this-is-the-first-of-two-articles-about-recent-developments-in-fashion-technology-part-two-will-focus-on-implications-for-consumer-privacy&#34;&gt;This is the first of two articles about recent developments in fashion technology. Part two will focus on implications for consumer privacy.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next frontier for recommender systems is the retail store. We’re used to associating machine learning with ecommerce giants like Gilt and Lyst, but can data science transform physical stores like Rebecca Minkoff and Zara? The impact would be significant, as more than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/digital-influences-in-retail-store-sales.html&#34;&gt;90% of retail sales still occur in brick-and-mortar stores&lt;/a&gt;, which could use data to redefine in-store personalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of data collection in the retail space does not always require new tools; rather, retailers can gather granular data on customers and products by repurposing existing hardware like security cameras and clothing sensors in new ways. Developments in machine learning have made it possible to auto-process existing video feeds to track customers, from simple movement analytics to full body profiles. Smart mirrors, security cameras (CCTV) and radio-frequency identification (RFID) sensors which create rich datasets that make automated personalization in bricks &amp;amp; mortar scalable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
