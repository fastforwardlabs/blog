      <description>Today’s post is inspired by a slow-motion recording we captured of a Stirling engine that Ryan, Fast Forward’s General Counsel, just so happened to have lying around our New York City offices. For the non-mechanics among us, a Stirling engine is a heat engine that operates by cyclic compression and expansion of air and other gas at different temperatures; the temperature differential translates heat into mechanical work. The slowmo in the video renders a hypnotic locomotive sound that differs greatly from the mechanic buzz of realtime.</description>
