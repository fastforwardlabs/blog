      <description>This article is available as a notebook on Github. Please refer to that notebook for a more detailed discussion and code fixes and updates. Despite all the recent excitement around deep learning, neural networks have a reputation among non-specialists as complicated to build and difficult to interpret.
And while interpretability remains an issue, there are now high-level neural network libraries that enable developers to quickly build neural network models without worrying about the numerical details of floating point operations and linear algebra.</description>
