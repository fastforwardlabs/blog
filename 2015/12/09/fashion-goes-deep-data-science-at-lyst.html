<p><b>What is Lyst and what is its business model? </b></p><p>Lyst is a London-based online fashion marketplace similar to companies like <a href="http://www.asos.com/?hrd=1">Asos</a> or <a href="http://www.net-a-porter.com/">Net-A-Porter</a>. We don’t own any fashion products ourselves, but resell them on behalf of affiliated brands and retailers. We actually started off as a purely affiliate marketplace, where retailers rewarded us for driving web traffic to their sites. We scraped the web for semi-structured information about fashion products and then applied machine learning to present this information cleanly and elegantly for consumers from one central website. To make this experience more seamless, we eventually added an our own online checkout system where users could build a look combining different brands and then purchase everything directly from Lyst. We then send transaction information to individual retailers for shipping. </p><p><b>What’s your background and how did you end up working in fashion? </b></p><p>I studied machine learning and pure mathematics in graduate school, but was always drawn to applied and practical problems, to the possibility of building systems that seemed like magic to end users. I started my career working on financial trading systems, but was intrigued by the creativity of working with image data, which comprises the bulk of data we work with in the fashion and retail space. I’ve been at Lyst for the past three years. </p><p><b>How does your data team provide personalized product recommendations to Lyst users? </b></p><p>We started off with a collaborative filtering approach, basing recommendations to given user on items liked and purchased by similar users in the past. Unfortunately, this didn’t work well for our data set. As Lyst sells 11 million items that constantly go in and out of stock, our item-user interaction matrix wasn’t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix">dense</a> (i.e. where most elements are nonzero) and we could never be sure that a given item would be available for the next user. </p><p>So we needed a better approach. My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/Maciej_Kula">Maciej Kula</a> lead research and engineering efforts to build a new recommendation model called <a href="https://github.com/lyst/lightfm">LightFM</a> that incorporates item and user metadata into a matrix factorization algorithm. LightFM represents each user and item as the sum of the latent representations of their features, allowing recommendations to generalize to new items (via item features) and to new users (via user features). If a registered Lyst user likes ten items with certain features, we recommend other items with similar features. </p><p>We also modulate the frequency and density of recommendations to match user engagement with the site. For example, if a user signs in and looks at three different styles of Wellington boots, we’ll serve up multiple images of similar boots during that browsing session and quickly decay the frequency in future sessions.</p><figure data-orig-width="674" data-orig-height="398" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/3b6ba56945b0ef2e336b1e1c2592ae8b/tumblr_inline_nz3ehxLPGZ1ta78fg_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="674" data-orig-height="398"/></figure><p><b>What about recommendations for consumers who don’t have a registered Lyst account?</b></p><p>We deal with this often given traffic to our site from Google advertisements or search results. Demographic segmentation across brands gives us a good place to start: if a user lands on a Gucci bag, we have a general idea that he or she is interested in luxury products, so we won’t show Zara street wear. Ultimately, however, the value of this social, demographic segmentation is limited. Someone who likes Gucci bags may prefer Prada dresses and Jimmy Choo shoes – one key value at Lyst is that we can aggregate recommendations to curate taste across different brands. </p><p><b>What machine learning techniques do you use to recognize features in fashion product images? </b></p><p>One of the key challenges in image processing for fashion is to recognize duplicates of the same item, as you don’t want to serve multiple images of the same product in different contexts (one Gucci dress on or off the model) or colors (a Uniqlo shirt in white, black, or orange) to the same user. Old school visual processing techniques analyzed images to look for areas of gradient change, which often correlated with product features. The algorithms converted points of interest into a vector, and we compared vectors from different images to find matches to signal duplicates. For example, we could match a picture of a woman wearing an earring with an image of that earring on a blank background. This approach worked for certain stark patterns or shapes, but didn’t perform well with features like the local texture of a pair of blue jeans. They were also entirely <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/olRZo/unsupervised-learning">unsupervised</a>, so we couldn’t fine tune them. </p><p><b>That was the old school approach. Have you started using deep learning methods for image analysis?  </b></p><p>We’re actually in the process of training the Lyst <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Conv-Nets-Modular/">convolutional neural network</a> now, and predict it will provide a massive boost in accuracy and performance on feature detection and product duplicate identification. Employing <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/supervised-learning-machine-learning-workflow-and-algorithms.html">supervised</a> learning, we’re training the deep representation model on 5 million labeled images and fine tuning the network to boost accuracy. Our labeling team combines workers from Amazon’s <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Mechanical Turk</a>, remote contract moderators, and internal full-time moderators. We have a consensus process whereby each moderator gets a score proportional to their agreement with other moderators. The higher a score a moderator has, the more weight he/she has. At Lyst, we have a lot of models that use the <a href="https://medium.com/the-wtf-economy/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-work-a0eaabea7c41%22%20%5Cl%20%22.xc7zgmslj">human-in-the-loop</a> methodology. Ultimately, our consensus process becomes encoded as intelligence in the model and we need fewer moderators to have confident labels. </p><p>We are building a network that has one “deep” representation of each product, metaphorically the network’s master concept of a given product. Like a natural language concept, we need a many-to-one as opposed to a one-to-one relationship between images and representations. Take a Gucci dress as an example. The Lyst data set may have an image of the dress on the hanger in the store, on the runway, on a static model, on people on the streets, or even written product descriptions of varying length. We want to use all this data to create one representation: “Gucci dress.” </p><p><b>What’s one challenge you’ve encountered while building your deep learning model and how did you address it?  </b></p><p>One challenge is that we have different quantities of text and image data for different items. To address this, we found additional fashion data from the internet, and are playing with the idea of synthetically generating labeled data to train our network. This hack was inspired by talks I saw at the 2015 <a href="http://www.iclr.cc/doku.php">ICLR</a> (the International Conference on Learning Representations) in San Diego. As it can be cost prohibitive for small research groups to acquire data sets with millions of labeled images, people have started to synthetically increase the size of their data sets through multisampling (where each image is cropped in multiple ways, or flipped horizontally and vertically) or introducing noise into the input every time a piece of data is shown to the network (which improves performance on rotated or zoomed in images). </p><p>Another technique we’re using to improve duplicate detection is called a region-based convolutional neural network, or <a href="https://github.com/rbg">R-CNN</a>. We try to estimate bounding boxes around items or features in images to isolate garments or parts of items instead of looking at the images globally. </p><p><b>When we built </b><a href="http://pictograph.us"><b>Pictograph</b></a><b>, our deep learning prototype, we chose to </b><a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2015/11/17/when-dog-is-enough-using-hypernyms-to-improve.html"><b>manage low confidence labels</b></a><b> by leveraging semantic relationships in WordNet, which is the backbone for ImageNet. Are you employing anything similar to manage low confidence labels in your network? </b></p><p>Yes, we do use analogous techniques. We have a fashion ontology affiliated with the Lyst network. This forms a semantic tree with men and women at the top of the tree, followed by item types (e.g. shirts, shoes, or jewelry) as branches, and specific items  (e.g. leather wedge sandals) as leaves. The network is trained on each individual, specific level as well as the full path through the tree. So if there is low confidence in classifying an item as “leather wedge sandal,” there may be higher confidence in saying it’s a ladies shoe, not a men’s suit. Our human in the loop consensus method also helps train the network across these semantic lines. </p><p><b>What will the fashion industry will look like in the future? </b></p><p>The key question is whether traditional retailers will <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2015/08/19/machine-learning-applications-in-fashion-retail.html">incorporate technology into operations and strategy</a> or derive value from data and technologies through partnerships with companies like Lyst. Our partnership team is working hard to educate high-end, traditional brands of the value modern data science techniques can provide to their business. A key obstacle is their fear that they would lose control over their branding strategy: a high-end retailer like Prada doesn’t want its image mixed up with H&amp;M or Zara on a central platform like Lyst. But we’ve seen tremendous adoption by consumers who like to have their own control to mix and match products and create their own look. With capabilities like deep learning really taking off, we’re excited to see what comes next!</p>

    Video footage constitutes a significant portion of all data in the world. The 30 thousand hours of video uploaded to Youtube every hour is a part of that data; another portion is produced by 770 million surveillance cameras globally. In addition to being plentiful, video data has tremendous capacity to store useful information. Its vastness, richness, and applicability make the understanding of video a key activity within the field of computer vision.

    Automatic summarization is a task in which a machine distills a large amount of data into a subset (the summary) that retains the most relevant and important information from the whole. While traditionally applied to text, automatic summarization can include other formats such as images or audio. In this article we’ll cover the main approaches to automatic text summarization, talk about what makes for a good summary, and introduce Summarize. &ndash; a summarization prototype we built that showcases several automatic summarization techniques.

    In extractive summarization, the task is to identify a subset of text (e.g., sentences) from a document that can then be assembled into a summary. Overall, we can treat extractive summarization as a recommendation problem. That is, given a query, recommend a set of sentences that are relevant. The query here is the document, relevance is a measure of whether a given sentence belongs in the document summary.
How we go about obtaining this measure of relevance varies (a common dilemma for any recommendation system).

    The Gensim library is a staple of the NLP stack. While it primarily focuses on topic modeling and similarity for documents, it also supports several word embedding algorithms, including what is likely the best-known implementation of Word2Vec.
Word embedding models like Word2Vec use unlabeled data to learn vector representations for each token in a corpus. These embeddings can then be used as features in myriad downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or recommendation systems.

The machine learning life cycle is more than data + model = API. We know there is a wealth of subtlety and finesse involved in data cleaning and feature engineering. In the same vein, there is more to model-building than feeding data in and reading off a prediction. ML model building requires thoughtfulness both in terms of which metric to optimize for a given problem, and how best to optimize your model for that metric!

  <div class="small">Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of a target domain change overtime causing model performance to degrade. Drift detection is generally achieved by monitoring a performance metric of interest and triggering a retraining pipeline when that metric falls below some designated threshold. However, this approach assumes ample labeled data is available at prediction time - an unrealistic constraint for many production systems. In this report, we explore various approaches for dealing with concept drift when labeled data is not readily accessible.</div>

  <div class="small">Being able to recommend an item of interest to a user (based on their past preferences) is a highly relevant problem in practice. A key trend over the past few years has been session-based recommendation algorithms that provide recommendations solely based on a user’s interactions in an ongoing session, and which do not require the existence of user profiles or their entire historical preferences. This report explores a simple, yet powerful, NLP-based approach (word2vec) to recommend a next item to a user. While NLP-based approaches are generally employed for linguistic tasks, here we exploit them to learn the structure induced by a user’s behavior or an item’s nature.</div>

  <div class="small">Text classification can be used for sentiment analysis, topic assignment, document identification, article recommendation, and more. While dozens of techniques now exist for this fundamental task, many of them require massive amounts of labeled data in order to be useful. Collecting annotations for your use case is typically one of the most costly parts of any machine learning application. In this report, we explore how latent text embeddings can be used with few (or even zero) training examples and provide insights into best practices for implementing this method.</div>
