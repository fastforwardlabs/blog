<p><b>Reasonable Expectations for Privacy</b></p><p>Before retailers invest resources to model consumer data, they should ask whether users would respond better to less personalized advertising experiences. There’s a difference between personal preferences and personal traits. A personalized experience that tends to an individual’s preferences can feel bespoke, high-service, and attentive to the consumer’s needs. A personalized experience generated by traits or demographics can feel more like differential treatment, where the experience is triggered by a collection of “contexts” sensed about the consumer.</p><p>Adobe and Page Fair <a href="http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/2015_report-the_cost_of_ad_blocking.pdf">point out</a> that there are nearly 200 million active users of ad blocking software, costing advertisers about $22 billion dollars a year, with 48% growth in the US over last year. In addition, in a 2000-person <a href="http://www.altimetergroup.com/2015/06/new-report-consumer-perceptions-of-privacy-in-the-internet-of-things/">survey from Altimeter Group</a>, all age groups expressed concern about data collected in public, with specific discomfort around use of body data. Retailers should keep consumer tolerance in mind as new sensors and software makes it easier to capture extremely detailed profiles of in-store shoppers.</p><p>Technology always outpaces policy and law, and to date retailers lack precedent for providing consumers with privacy policies articulating passive data collection practices. Some tech companies, like <a href="https://prism.com/">Prism Skylabs</a> sidestep privacy concerns by anonymizing personally identifiable data, giving “a sense of what’s happening in a store without having to be there physically counting customers or examining shelves.” Neiman Marcus, alternatively, <a href="https://www.internetretailer.com/2015/01/12/neiman-marcus-deploys-memory-mirror-clothes-shoppers">asks for explicit consent</a> to record gender, age, and body type data when testing their Memomi smart mirrors. </p><p>After a decade of digital ecommerce, many people’s expectations regarding online privacy have shifted to expect monitoring by retailers and advertisers. But the same does not hold in physical retail, where past methods of sales tracking amounted to conversations with sales associates or, at most, wifi tracking using mobile phones. But emerging technologies can do far more than track location: they can add sophisticated “metadata” about a consumer’s age, body measurements, and browsing habits. </p><p>To think through privacy expectations, researchers <a href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/tiny-constables-and-the-cost-of-surveillance-making-cents-out-of-united-states-v-jones">Soultani and Bankston</a> developed a model that relates individual expectations of privacy to technology costs. “If the cost of surveillance using the new technique is an order of magnitude (ten times) less than the cost of the surveillance without using the new technique,” they claim, “the new technique violates a reasonable expectation of privacy.” So what are the economics of the new tracking tools? <a href="http://www.nomi.com/">Nomi</a>’s Brickstream sensor costs as low as $20/month for a plan of 25 in-store sensors, amounting to at least $500/month (pricing may vary over time). If tracking consumer preferences - or bodies - were left to a sales associate making $28K/year, monthly costs would amount to at least $2333, notwithstanding the fact that a single person’s attention cannot scale across the customer base. The cost to track a single person quickly falls near $0 for a sensor that scales across the customer base. If we trust Soultani and Bankston’s model, the prices of these new tools trigger a re-evaluation of best practices for policy around privacy.</p><p><b>Technology Limitations Beyond Privacy</b></p><p>Even if consumers tolerate passive data collection, algorithmic pitfalls also impact user experience. Many machine learning systems learn using training datasets, which impact the predictions they make about new data in the wild. As <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878">boyd and Crawford</a> point out, “a data set may have millions of pieces of data, but this does not mean it’s random or representative.” Imagine generating a body-specific ad, or even matching existing inventory to a consumer’s body measurements. What happens if there is not enough data to generate a realistic representation of an individual? If nothing in a store’s inventory fits a customer’s body? If a 15-year-old girl’s body best matches 40-year-old women in your database? Would automated suggestions pull up inventory more appropriate for older customers, alienating her in front of friends with bodies more like the average 15-year-old? </p><p>A careful, opt-in experience does have the power to create experiences that were much harder to scale in the past. Companies like Slyce, Cortexica, Deepomatic, and Donde Fashion are harnessing deep learning to augment the browsing experience. During New York Fashion Week this month, Cortexica pointed out the challenge of finding the right item when a shopper brings a photo of what he/she wants that might not exactly match inventory. Without requiring an item tag, their software analyzes photo data to suggest items with similar colors and textures, within or across detected categories. Here, software augments customer preferences rather than prescribing preferences from passive data collection about multiple consumers. Shopping is all the more fun when a photo of a sunflower is game for inspiration like a street style star. </p><p>-Jessica</p>

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

    Why do privacy and governance matter? Data privacy has been a common conversation topic among the general public since the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. The data &ldquo;breach,&rdquo; in which user information was hoovered up through a Facebook quiz and subsequently misrepresented as being used for academic purposes, resulted in over $5 billion in fines for Facebook. However, Facebook&rsquo;s infringements were, in fact, relatively narrow in scope (though nonetheless egregious) compared to the growing remit of privacy law.

  <div class="small">Interpretability, or the ability to explain why and how a system makes a decision, can help us improve models, satisfy regulations, and build better products. Black-box techniques like deep learning have delivered breakthrough capabilities at the cost of interpretability. In this report, recently updated to include techniques like SHAP, we show how to make models interpretable without sacrificing their capabilities or accuracy.</div>
