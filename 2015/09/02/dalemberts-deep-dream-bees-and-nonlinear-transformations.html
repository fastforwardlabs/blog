Sign up <a href="https://deeplearningwebinar.splashthat.com/">here</a>!</p><p>As a philosophical prelude to the upcoming report, we wanted to invite you to think about the emergent properties of neural nets. Let’s explore what 18th-century philosopher Denis Diderot can teach us about artificial intelligence.</p><p>Diderot was not your average Enlightenment philosopher. A <i>philosophe, </i>he grappled with the colossal inheritance of mechanical philosophy that dominated 18th-century intellectual circles. Spearheaded by Descartes and Newton, the mechanical view held that the material world was composed of complicated machines governed and determined by immutable laws. </p>
<p>But Diderot and a few contemporaries noticed that Newtonian mechanics, while powerful for describing celestial phenomena, did a poor job describing living organisms. Arguing against his predecessors, Diderot proposed that life - like sentience and consciousness - emerges from the complex interaction between many small constituent parts. He illustrates the idea in his 1769 “<a href="https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/files/Dalemberts_Dream.pdf">D’Alembert’s Dream”</a> with the metaphor of a swarm of bees: </p><p>“Have you sometimes seen a swarm of bees going out of their hive? This cluster is like an individual. If one of the bees pinches the bee next to it, the second bee would then pinch the one next to it in turn, until in the entire cluster there would be as many sensations aroused as there are small animals. Someone who had never seen a group like that arrange itself would be tempted to assume it was one single animal with five or six hundred heads and a thousand or twelve hundred wings&hellip;” </p><p>Anyone familiar with Google’s <a href="http://deepdreamgenerator.com/">Deep Dream</a> might picture D’Alembert’s twelve-hundred winged swarm of bees like the many-eyed mutants generated by Google’s API. When I imported an image of a beehive, Deep Dream transformed it into a two-headed duck-rooster placidly perching in a tree:</p><figure data-orig-width="432" data-orig-height="288" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/56274ca68b9f35b0431de160654a4012/tumblr_inline_nu1wuinO201ta78fg_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="432" data-orig-height="288"/></figure><p>But Google did not create Deep Dream only to generate psychedelic images. Rather, Deep Dream is a tool to investigate how neural networks identify features in images and encode these features at each of their various layers. </p><p>Indeed, one of the drawbacks of <a href="http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html">convolutional neural networks</a> underlying image-object recognition work is that the very feedback mechanisms that enable us to train the network generate an “unpredictable” system that, according to Slate columnist <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/07/google_deepdream_it_s_dazzling_creepy_and_tells_us_a_lot_about_the_future.2.html">David Auerbach</a>, is neither rational nor algorithmic. </p><p>Convolutional networks use a class of algorithms called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernels</a>” that encode the spatial features of images (e.g. the sharp edge of a beehive has the same features of a duck beak) into matrices; neural nets then use vectors and linear algebra to transform the data layer by layer, first to encode the data’s features and then to filter them based on how a model has &ldquo;learned&rdquo; to categorize those features. But as these transformations are nonlinear, we cannot identify what features each layer is encoding. </p><p>As such, the behavior of the neural network emerges from the complex interaction at play between the various layers. To return to Diderot, we might envision the various nodes in a neural network like individual bees that, when swarming together, generate a whole that supersedes the sum of its parts to become something new.</p><p>Will these emergent properties, then, be the secret to generating artificial sentience and consciousness? John Stuart Mill, after all, claimed that the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/">human mind emerged </a>from the complex interaction of brain matter. But, as we explain in our upcoming deep learning report, neural networks are extraordinarily rigid in contrast to the plasticity of the human brain.

    Given a question and a passage, the task of Question Answering (QA) focuses on identifying the exact span within the passage that answers the question.
Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

  <div class="small">In contrast to how humans learn, deep learning algorithms need vast amounts of data and compute and may yet struggle to generalize. Humans are successful in adapting quickly because they leverage their knowledge acquired from prior experience when faced with new problems. In this report, we explain how meta-learning can leverage previous knowledge acquired from data to solve novel tasks quickly and more efficiently during test time</div>

  <div class="small">Interpretability, or the ability to explain why and how a system makes a decision, can help us improve models, satisfy regulations, and build better products. Black-box techniques like deep learning have delivered breakthrough capabilities at the cost of interpretability. In this report, recently updated to include techniques like SHAP, we show how to make models interpretable without sacrificing their capabilities or accuracy.</div>
