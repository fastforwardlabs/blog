But we decided to adopt a different approach.</p>
<p><b>ImageNet and WordNet</b></p><p>ImageNet is not just a collection of images arranged arbitrarily. <a href="http://www.web3.lu/wordnet-imagenet/">It is organized</a> according to the hierarchy found in the lexical database <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a>, whose “structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.” Like a thesaurus, WordNet groups different nouns (we’ll focus on nouns because ImageNet does not use verbs, adjectives, or adverbs) together into sets of synonyms, or synsets. Synsets express concepts (e.g., car = automobile) between which WordNet can generate relationships. </p><p>In WordNet, the most frequent relation among synsets is hyponymy and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponymy_and_hypernymy">hypernymy</a>. A bit of Ancient Greek helps here: <i>onomas</i> means name; <i>hypo</i> means under; and<i> hyper </i>means over. So a hyponym is an “undername,” a more specific instance of a concept (blenheim spaniel is a hyponym of dog). And a hypernym is an “overname,” a more general instance of a concept (domestic animal is a hypernym of dog). In WordNet, all noun hierarchies ultimately go up to “entity.” (A bit more Ancient Greek has muddied the metaphysical waters for centuries, with Aristotle’s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover">unmoved mover</a> </i>inspiring Spinoza’s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causa_sui">causa sui</a>, </i>but I digress&hellip;) </p><p>Note that a hyponymy relation is transitive: if an blenheim spaniel is a kind of dog, and if a dog is a kind of domestic animal, then a blenheim spaniel is a kind of domestic animal. <i>And here is the key: a neural network can use this transitive property to manage low confidence predictions.</i> How?</p><p><b>Using Clustering to Unlock Network Intelligence</b><br/></p><figure data-orig-width="944" data-orig-height="380" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/e4c46108bfdbd3f1d8dc32425c03de96/tumblr_inline_nxyv8jrTAf1ta78fg_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="944" data-orig-height="380"/></figure><p>Consider this image. Fathom, the advanced deep learning prototype we provide to our clients, isn’t sure whether this is a dingo (47%) or a chihuahua (24%). One approach would be to simply select the maximum likely prediction and label this a dingo (which I believe is correct?). But that ignores other information the network is providing. A 24% confidence rate that this is a chihuahua, a 8% confidence rate that this is a basenji, and no mention that this is a siamese cat or an Arabian stallion, all tell us something: that this is not a cat and not a horse, but some type of dog. Even if the network does not deliver the most precise knowledge possible with absolute confidence, it can use the transitive relationship between hypernyms to know this is a dog (and a domestic animal, and, well, an entity of some sort). </p><figure data-orig-width="482" data-orig-height="379" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/3b0a0971f5af46ad07ee8093b4551b88/tumblr_inline_nxyvvdzedz1ta78fg_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="482" data-orig-height="379"/></figure><p>Augmenting label predictions through a clustering scheme can be incredibly important to make neural networks valuable in practice. Data teams constantly face challenges in managing noise, and those challenges won’t disappear with deep learning. The quality of the results will always depend on the extent to which new data is like or dislike data in the original training set; this relationship is further impacted by the size of the training set. </p><p>When considering a deep learning project, one initial question data teams can ask is how important it is for the given problem that the neural net return extremely precise classifications. If you’re using a neural network to identify tumors in MRIs, you may need to go for maximum likelihood. But if you’re using the tools for fashion retail, knowing that something is a skirt as opposed to a Marc Jacobs skirt may be good enough (happy to be corrected).</p><p>After all, we may have an anonymous office dog, but that doesn’t mean we don’t adore him.</p><figure data-orig-width="421" data-orig-height="325" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/66880b0a5cfc7b40c98628ff9a5eabd8/tumblr_inline_nxywfwe5gH1ta78fg_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="421" data-orig-height="325"/></figure><p>-Kathryn</p>

Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase. Recently, our team at Fast Forward Labs have been exploring state of the art models for Question Answering and have used the rather excellent HuggingFace transformers library.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    Welcome to the first edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward blog on Natural Language Processing for Question Answering! Throughout this series, we’ll build a Question Answering (QA) system with off-the-shelf algorithms and libraries and blog about our process and what we find along the way. We hope to wind up with a beginning-to-end documentary that provides:

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

    Introduction This is the first part of a series to review Bias in Knowledge Graphs (KG). We aim to describe methods of identifying bias, measuring its impact, and mitigating that impact. For this part, we’ll give a broad overview of this topic.

  <div class="small">Interpretability, or the ability to explain why and how a system makes a decision, can help us improve models, satisfy regulations, and build better products. Black-box techniques like deep learning have delivered breakthrough capabilities at the cost of interpretability. In this report, recently updated to include techniques like SHAP, we show how to make models interpretable without sacrificing their capabilities or accuracy.</div>
