    <h1>Progress in machine learning interpretability</h1>
    <p>Our goal when we do research is to address capabilities and technologies that
we expect to become production-ready in one to two years. That focus on
fast-moving areas means that new algorithmic ideas sometimes come along that
allow our clients to extend or improve upon the work in our reports.</p>
<p>We published our report on machine learning interpretability last year. The technical focus of our report was LIME, a tool that computes locally
correct explanations of a model&rsquo;s behaviour. If a model is good, LIME&rsquo;s
explanations can offer completely new insights. (We saw this in our prototype,
which models customer churn using traditional machine learning techniques, but
then uses LIME to say precisely what it is about a customer that makes them a
churn risk.) And if a model is bad, LIME can help you understand why.</p>
<p>This all sounds great, but we had to leave three issues unresolved in our
report. Progress since last year has begun to address those concerns.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/07/lime-1530894622923.png" alt=""></p>
<h5 id="lime-explanations-of-sentiment-classification-not-is-a-positive-word-in-one-example-but-not-in-another-image-credit-anchorshttpshomescswashingtonedumarcotcraaai18pdf">LIME explanations of sentiment classification. &ldquo;Not&rdquo; is a positive word in one example, but not in another. Image credit: <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf">Anchors</a>.</h5>
<p>Firstly, LIME&rsquo;s explanations are local. For example, a LIME explanation may
(correctly) tell you that &ldquo;This movie is not bad&rdquo; has positive sentiment
because it contains the word &ldquo;not.&rdquo; But because LIME&rsquo;s explanations are local,
a user is not generally entitled to conclude from this that the word &ldquo;not&rdquo;
always indicates positive sentiment. This makes sense: the presence of &ldquo;not&rdquo; in
&ldquo;this movie is not very good&rdquo; does not tell you its sentiment is positive! But
how local is &ldquo;local&rdquo;? How similar to the original sentence does a new sentence
need to be for LIME&rsquo;s explanation to apply?</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/07/anchor-1530894675267.png" alt=""></p>
<h5 id="anchors-explanations-of-sentiment-classification-not-is-a-positive-word-in-combination-with-bad-image-credit-anchorshttpshomescswashingtonedumarcotcraaai18pdf">Anchors explanations of sentiment classification. &ldquo;Not&rdquo; is a positive word in combination with &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; Image credit: <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf">Anchors</a>.</h5>
<p>The creators of LIME offer an answer to this question in the form of <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf"><em>Anchors:
High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations</em>(PDF,
2.7MB)</a>.&rdquo; Anchors works
like LIME in that it probes the behaviour of the black-box model by perturbing
the original example. But it takes a very different approach to constructing a
human-friendly explanation. Rather than fit a locally correct linear model
(which raises the question: how local?), it constructs a set of rules. For the
&ldquo;this movie is not bad&rdquo; example above, the rule might be &ldquo;sentence contains
&lsquo;not&rsquo; <em>and</em> &lsquo;bad&rsquo;&quot;. Such black and white rules are easier for many people to
understand than quantitative weights. And they implicitly define locality: if
the sentence doesn&rsquo;t contain &ldquo;not&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; the rule (and the explanation)
doesn&rsquo;t apply. The <a href="https://github.com/marcotcr/anchor">Anchors code is publicly
available</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/artwork/boston_instance.png" alt=""></p>
<h5 id="shaphttpsgithubcomslundbergshap-explanation-of-a-prediction-for-a-model-of-the-boston-house-price-dataset"><a href="https://github.com/slundberg/shap">SHAP</a> explanation of a prediction for a model of the Boston house price dataset.</h5>
<p>Secondly, LIME&rsquo;s choice of perturbation strategy and its local linear model are
heuristics &ndash; which is to say they feel a little arbitrary, and it&rsquo;s reasonable
to wonder whether they are optimal in practice. In <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions.pdf">A Unified Approach to
Interpreting Model
Predictions</a>
Lundberg and Lee carefully define what we mean by optimal, and show that LIME
is a specific example of a more general class of explanation tools they call
&ldquo;additive feature attribution methods.&rdquo; This class includes the classical
&ldquo;Shapley&rdquo; feature importance measure familiar to economists, and
<a href="https://github.com/kundajelab/deeplift">DeepLIFT</a>, a neural network
interpretability tool. They unify this class in a provably optimal way they
call <a href="https://github.com/slundberg/shap">SHAP</a>. The code is public, and is
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03888">highly optimized</a> for the particular case of
tree-based methods such as XGboost. One thing we really like about SHAP is that
the built-in visualization tools are very nice! This seemingly minor point is
surprisingly important to the adoption of new tools, and we&rsquo;re glad to see
these authors spend time on this aspect of their code.</p>
<p>Finally, how do we <em>test</em> explanations? How do we know whether an explanation
is evidence of a problem with the model or a surprising insight? Patrick Hall
and colleagues at <a href="https://www.h2o.ai/">H2O.ai</a> sum up the current situation very well in a new
article for O&rsquo;Reilly <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/testing-machine-learning-interpretability-techniques">Testing machine learning interpretability
techniques</a>.
The conclusion is: &ldquo;use more than one type of tool to explain your machine
learning models, and look for consistent results across different explanatory
methods.&rdquo; We agree, and we&rsquo;re glad to see new options such as Anchors and SHAP
that make this easy!</p>
<p>So, a year after our report, machine learning interpretability remains not only
a very useful business capability, but a vibrant area of research.</p>

    199  // ... code   -- Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase. Recently, our team at Fast Forward Labs have been exploring state of the art models for Question Answering and have used the rather excellent HuggingFace transformers library.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    Welcome to the first edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward blog on Natural Language Processing for Question Answering! Throughout this series, we’ll build a Question Answering (QA) system with off-the-shelf algorithms and libraries and blog about our process and what we find along the way. We hope to wind up with a beginning-to-end documentary that provides:

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

  <div class="small">Interpretability, or the ability to explain why and how a system makes a decision, can help us improve models, satisfy regulations, and build better products. Black-box techniques like deep learning have delivered breakthrough capabilities at the cost of interpretability. In this report, recently updated to include techniques like SHAP, we show how to make models interpretable without sacrificing their capabilities or accuracy.</div>
