    <h1>Exploring Recommendation Systems</h1>
    <p>While we commonly associate recommendation systems with e-commerce, their
application extends to any decision-making problem which requires pairing two
types of things together. To understand why recommenders don&rsquo;t always work as
well as we&rsquo;d like them to, we set out to build some basic recommendation systems
using publicly available data.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>The first ingredient for building a recommendation system is user interaction
data. We experimented with two different datasets, one from Flickr and one from
Amazon. The Flickr dataset contains interactions between users and photos that
they liked; the Amazon dataset contains user ratings on books. Both datasets are
time-stamped. The Flickr dataset has positive class data only (i.e. liked
photos), while the Amazon dataset has granular ratings data ranging from 1 to 5.</p>
<p>In general, user interaction data is <em>sparse,</em> since a single user would only
have interacted with a small subset of items (think about how many movies you
have rated on Netflix). In addition, users tend to rate good items only, leading
to class imbalance. For datasets with granular ratings data, not only is it hard
for a user to differentiate 2 from 3, a 3 could also mean different things to
different users.</p>
<p>In recommendation systems, it is important to remove both users who have
interacted with many items and items that have many ratings. Intuitively, users
who like many items do not add any useful information to our system, as they are
not selective enough. Similarly, items that many users like will tend to be
overly recommended. To clean our dataset, we filtered out these cases. We then
split the dataset into two (training and testing), using a cutoff timestamp.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-recommender">Building the Recommender</h2>
<p>The goal of a recommendation system is to use historical interaction data to
recommend a new pairing (user and item) for the future. There are two
approaches. The first approach predicts an actual rating for a user-item pair
and recommends the highest rated item for that user. The second approach
predicts a ranking of items and recommends the highest ranked item for a
user. Our experiment focuses on the first approach. The recommenders are
evaluated using standard metrics such as area under curve (AUC) and root mean
squared error (RMSE).</p>
<p>AUC computes the area under the ROC curve for classification problems, and a
larger number is better. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">ROC</a> curve
plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate. We want a
classifier that correctly identifies as many positive instances as are available, with
a very low percentage of negative instances incorrectly classified as
positive. As a result, the ROC curve of a perfect classifier will go straight up
the y axis (true positive rate) and then along the x axis (false positive
rate). A classifier with no power will sit on the x=y diagonal. RMSE computes
how far the predicted value is from the actual value.</p>
<h3 id="basic-photo-recommendation-system">Basic photo recommendation system</h3>
<p>To quickly get a recommender up and running, we used a Python scikit called
<a href="https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise">SURPRISE</a>. The package has various
built-in recommendation algorithms including ones based on neighborhood approach
and matrix factorization. Neighborhood approach finds a group of users who are
similar to you and assumes that you share the same item preferences. The
algorithm then recommends to you items that these users have liked. Matrix
factorization represents users and items using a set of factors and predicts
user preference for items using a linear combination of these factors. Because a
recommender needs to know both what a user liked and disliked, we used
heuristics to infer negative ratings for the Flickr dataset. (An example
heuristic is to assume that <em>x</em> number of photos before the <em>liked</em> photo are
disliked.)</p>
<p>With both positive and negative ratings, we were ready to plug our data into
SURPRISE. To do so, we transformed it into a text file that provides four pieces
of information {userid, photoid, rating, timestamp}, where a rating is either a 1
or 5.</p>

<h3 id="photo-recommender-with-tags">Photo recommender with Tags</h3>
<p>Could we build a better recommendation system if we made use of the tag
information that comes for free with the Flickr dataset? Instead of describing a
photo using its id (a series of numbers), we used tags like <em>sunset, bridge,
Brooklyn</em>. Why? First, by doing so, we hoped to add more information to the
interaction matrix. Second, our basic photo recommender was unable to recommend
a new photo because it did not have any historical interaction
information. Since it did not know who had interacted with this photo and what
the outcome of the interaction was, it did not know how to recommend this new
item. (This is known as the <em>cold start</em> problem.) By adding tags, we built
a system that understands the content of what it is recommending. With this
understanding comes the ability to recommend items that it has never seen
before. A new photo is no longer new to the system; it can be represented by a
set of tags that the system has seen before.</p>
<p>When we describe a photo with a set of tags, each column of the input matrix is
now a tag (vs a photo id). As such, the size of the input matrix becomes much
larger. For each user, the recommender returns a set of tags and their
corresponding scores. To get back a photo recommendation, these tag scores need
to be converted to photo scores. For each photo, we compute its score by i)
comparing the recommended tags to the set of tags representing the photo, ii)
finding the common tags between them, iii) adding up the scores for the common
tags and iv) normalizing by the number of common tags. All photos are ranked
using this score and the top one is recommended. Once tag information is
incorporated, our ROC curve looked much better!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/01/ROC_NMF_tag_loop_1115_nodot.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="basic-book-recommendation-system">Basic book recommendation system</h3>
<p>Our recommender based on Flickr&rsquo;s dataset required inferred negative
ratings. Amazon&rsquo;s user rating dataset, on the other hand, provides rating
information ranging from 1 to 5. We tested two recommenders on this dataset: the
first was a recommender we built using Python&rsquo;s scikit-learn package; the second
was a recommender put together using
<a href="https://github.com/maciejkula/spotlight">Spotlight</a>, a PyTorch based
recommendation package. In our scikit-learn implementation we incorporated both
matrix factorization and neighborhood-based algorithms. In the Spotlight
recommender, we built an engine using matrix factorization since Spotlight does
not support neighborhood based-approaches. All recommenders are evaluated using
RMSE.</p>
<p>We cleaned and separated the Amazon dataset into training and testing sets using the same
approach as we did with the Flickr dataset. From here, we transformed the input data into an
interaction matrix for our sklearn-based recommender. Each row in the
interaction matrix represents a user and each column represents a book. For
Spotlight, this interaction matrix is converted into a custom <em>interactions</em>
object. This object takes in three arrays: user ID, book ID, and ratings
information. The user ID is the row index for our interaction matrix, the book
ID is the column index, and the rating information is the value of the
interaction matrix. Here is the code snippet.</p>

system built using only user and book ratings information.</p>
<h3 id="book-recommender-with-subject">Book Recommender with Subject</h3>
<p>What if we added some content information to the books? In the Flickr dataset,
each photo already has a set of tags associated with it; content information is
free! For the Amazon dataset, we obtained subject information using the open
library API. This allowed us to identify a book using its subject. Each column in
our interaction matrix is now a subject rather than a book ID. Since multiple
books can be mapped to the same subject, our input matrix is smaller and
denser. (This is in contrast to the Flickr dataset, where adding content
information expanded the input matrix.) Ratings that a user assigned for books
with the same subject are aggregated into a single rating for that particular
subject. To obtain a recommended rating on a book, we mapped the book to its
subject and read off that recommendation. With subject information, the RMSE
improved by approximately 2-fold across the board! Unfortunately, we also saw
that most of the algorithms do not work since they perform worse than a random
recommender when we use RMSE as a metric.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-learned">What we learned</h2>
<h3 id="raw-material">Raw material</h3>
<p>Data makes all the difference. Traditional recommendation systems do not work
well because of the sparsity problem. Each user only rates a small percentage of
items in the universe, but recommendation systems rely on this weak signal to
make decisions.</p>
<p>To make a better system we need a denser matrix in order to extract a stronger
signal. In our example we used content information: tags for the Flickr dataset
and subjects for the Amazon dataset. Both cases saw dramatic
improvements.</p>
<p>Time-stamp information is also helpful because it makes the
problem amenable to some deep learning techniques. As an example, the prototype we built to
accompany our new Semantic Recommendations report uses deep features as a way of
extending the factorization models.</p>
<h3 id="does-a-basic-recommendation-system-work">Does a basic recommendation system work?</h3>
<p>A recommendation system built using matrix factorization or neighborhood
approaches trained on simple user-item interaction data is unlikely to give
great recommendations. In our experiment with the Amazon dataset, these
recommendation systems underperform a random system! Moreover, these systems
suffer from the cold start problem - they rely on historical interaction data
and cannot make recommendations on new items.</p>
<p>For more on recommendation systems, please see our new report! The Semantic
Recommendations report explores the current state of recommendation systems,
with a focus on how machines can better understand content. Armed with this
newfound understanding, we look at how systems can bypass the cold start problem
and expand their utility well beyond traditional e-commerce use cases.</p>

    Figure 1: Overview of representation learning methods. TLDR; Good representations of data (e.g., text, images) are critical for solving many tasks (e.g., search or recommendations). Deep representation learning yields state of the art results when used to create these representations. In this article, we review methods for representation learning and walk through an example using pretrained models.  Introduction Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become a particularly useful tool in building intelligent systems that simplify cognitive tasks for users.

    Given a question and a passage, the task of Question Answering (QA) focuses on identifying the exact span within the passage that answers the question.
Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    Welcome to the first edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward blog on Natural Language Processing for Question Answering! Throughout this series, we’ll build a Question Answering (QA) system with off-the-shelf algorithms and libraries and blog about our process and what we find along the way. We hope to wind up with a beginning-to-end documentary that provides:

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

  <div class="small">Text classification can be used for sentiment analysis, topic assignment, document identification, article recommendation, and more. While dozens of techniques now exist for this fundamental task, many of them require massive amounts of labeled data in order to be useful. Collecting annotations for your use case is typically one of the most costly parts of any machine learning application. In this report, we explore how latent text embeddings can be used with few (or even zero) training examples and provide insights into best practices for implementing this method.</div>
