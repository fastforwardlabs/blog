    <h1>Progress in text summarization</h1>
    <p>We published our report on text summarization in 2016. Since then, we&rsquo;ve
enjoyed helping our clients make use of techniques such as topic modeling,
document embedding, and recurrent neural networks to deal with text that ranges
in scope from product reviews to insurance documents to call transcripts to news.</p>
<p>Our goal when we do research is to address capabilities and technologies that
we expect to become production-ready in one to two years. That focus on
fast-moving areas means that new algorithmic ideas sometimes come along that
allow our clients to extend or improve upon the work in our reports. Prompted in
part by Yue Dong&rsquo;s March 2018 <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04589">Survey on Neural Network-Based Summarization
Methods</a></em>, we thought we&rsquo;d take some time to
describe the developments in text summarization since our report was published.</p>
<p>Put simply: there&rsquo;s bad news and there&rsquo;s good news.</p>
<p>The bad news is that we still don&rsquo;t think <em>abstractive</em> summarization is ready
for production prime time. <em>Extractive</em> summarization involves selecting a few
passages from a document or corpus and stitching them together to form a
summary. As we discuss in our report, <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/04/11/new-tools-to-summarize-text.html">this is a tough
problem</a>.
But <em>abstractive</em> summarization is harder still. Not only must you identify the
salient ideas, but you must also generate new text that expresses those ideas
concisely.</p>

<h5 id="pointer-network-for-summarization-credit-abigail-see-and-collaboratorshttpwwwabigailseecom20170416taming-rnns-for-better-summarizationhtml">Pointer network for summarization. Credit: <a href="http://www.abigailsee.com/2017/04/16/taming-rnns-for-better-summarization.html">Abigail See and collaborators</a></h5>
<p>There has been considerable progress along these lines. The current state of
the art is 2017&rsquo;s attention-based pointer networks, e.g. <a href="http://www.abigailsee.com/2017/04/16/taming-rnns-for-better-summarization.html">work from Abigail See
and collaborators at Stanford and Google
Brain</a>
and <a href="https://einstein.ai/research/your-tldr-by-an-ai-a-deep-reinforced-model-for-abstractive-summarization">Salesforce Research&rsquo;s work lead by Romain
Paulus</a>.</p>
<p>However, those authors would concede what <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07038">Noah Weber and collaborators showed
last month</a>: in practice, these abstractive
networks work by &ldquo;mostly, if not entirely, copying over phrases, sentences, and
sometimes multiple consecutive sentences from an input paragraph, effectively
performing extractive summarization.&rdquo; So, for now at least, you get the training
data requirements and engineering complexity of cutting-edge deep learning
without the practical performance increase. Which is not to say academic work
on abstractive summarization is at a dead end; we look forward to reporting on the
inevitable breakthroughs in a year or two.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we promised good news!</p>

<p>The good news is a couple of really nice papers that make concrete improvements
to <em>extractive</em> summarization. Both are from the same Edinburgh group. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04530">Neural
Extractive Summarization with Side
Information</a> (2017) takes advantage of a very
natural heuristic that was used in classical summarization algorithms: titles
and image captions are particularly strong signals of the important ideas in a
document. This heuristic is incorporated into an attention-based
encoder-decoder network, and they get <a href="http://kinloch.inf.ed.ac.uk/sidenet.html">really nice extractive
results</a>. If your source documents
have that kind of structure, this approach is worth investigating. More
ambitiously, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08636">Ranking Sentences for Extractive Summarization with
Reinforcement Learning</a> (2018) the same group
recasts extractive summarization as a reinforcement learning task. Unusually,
they learn to <em>rank</em> sentences in the source document rather than score them in isolation, which they argue results in more coherent (and less verbose) overall
summaries.</p>
<p>So, two years after our report, text summarization remains not only a useful
business capability, but a very vibrant area of research.</p>

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    Welcome to the first edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward blog on Natural Language Processing for Question Answering! Throughout this series, we’ll build a Question Answering (QA) system with off-the-shelf algorithms and libraries and blog about our process and what we find along the way. We hope to wind up with a beginning-to-end documentary that provides:

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

    Introduction This is the first part of a series to review Bias in Knowledge Graphs (KG). We aim to describe methods of identifying bias, measuring its impact, and mitigating that impact. For this part, we’ll give a broad overview of this topic.

    Why do privacy and governance matter? Data privacy has been a common conversation topic among the general public since the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. The data &ldquo;breach,&rdquo; in which user information was hoovered up through a Facebook quiz and subsequently misrepresented as being used for academic purposes, resulted in over $5 billion in fines for Facebook. However, Facebook&rsquo;s infringements were, in fact, relatively narrow in scope (though nonetheless egregious) compared to the growing remit of privacy law.

  <div class="small">The intersection of causal inference and machine learning is a rapidly expanding area of research that&#39;s already yielding capabilities to enable building more robust, reliable, and fair machine learning systems. This report offers an introduction to causal reasoning including causal graphs and invariant prediction and how to apply causal inference tools together with classic machine learning techniques in multiple use-cases.</div>

  <div class="small">Interpretability, or the ability to explain why and how a system makes a decision, can help us improve models, satisfy regulations, and build better products. Black-box techniques like deep learning have delivered breakthrough capabilities at the cost of interpretability. In this report, recently updated to include techniques like SHAP, we show how to make models interpretable without sacrificing their capabilities or accuracy.</div>

  <div class="small">From fraud detection to flagging abnormalities in imaging data, there are countless applications for automatic identification of abnormal data. This process can be challenging, especially when working with large, complex data. This report explores deep learning approaches (sequence models, VAEs, GANs) for anomaly detection, when to use them, performance benchmarks, and product possibilities.</div>
