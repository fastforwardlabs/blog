    <h1>Introducing SciFi</h1>
    <p>Today we are launching a <a href="https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/">mini-site featuring our collection of short stories inspired by new developments in machine learning</a>.   Beginning with our fourth report, we started including a science-fiction story along with the technical and strategic overviews that are the bulk of each report. Using these stories, we can look at the technologies we profile from a different angle and explore their cultural implications.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/">SciFi site</a> includes the four stories we have included so far. We will continue to commission and publish a story with each new report, and we are working on plans to open the process up to a wider range of voices.</p>
<p>Below you&rsquo;ll find some background and interpretation for each of the stories. I can speak authoritatively about the intent for the two that I wrote, but for the others, please note that these are my interpretations.</p>
<h2 id="mars-terraform-expansion-s-217">Mars Terraform Expansion S-217</h2>
<p><img src="https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/ff04-scifi_clusters-29d0aaa1f1849f40c08f2295ab4a3238.svg" alt="A network graph representation of different opinions on the Mars TerraformExpansion. Eco-conservative views are towards the left and expansionists towardthe right."></p>
<p>The <a href="https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/ff04/mars-terraform-expansion-s-217">first story</a> we published is the least narrative of the bunch. The report focused on summarization as a gateway to making text quantifiable (and therefore computable). In the story, I focused on imagining the kinds of interfaces that capability could enable. The system in the story is able to identify the key points of different articles and synthesize them into a coherent summary. It is also able to identify their political orientation and place them in relation to one another.</p>
<p>I continue to be fascinated by the summarization and mapping possibilities that natural language processing technologies could open up. I&rsquo;m especially interested by experiments in using deep learning and dimensionality reduction techniques to create visualizations of the relationships between different concepts (see for example, <a href="http://encartopedia.fastforwardlabs.com/#/">Sepand Ansari&rsquo;s Encartopedia</a>). If I were rewriting the story today, I think I would include some ambiguity about whether the system&rsquo;s representations were truly reliable. For a much more comprehensive look at how a similar information processing system could be both extremely useful and also dangerous, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071R1GVX2/">Nick Harkaway&rsquo;s mind-bending novel <em>Gnomon</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="bayeshead-5000">BayesHead 5000</h2>
<p><img src="https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/ff05-scifi-01-ec3c7869ee6382df7d32661e053fa87f.svg" alt="The letterhead for the fictional Monte Carlo Corporation. It features two dice where the dots spell out an &ldquo;M&rdquo; and a &ldquo;C&rdquo;."></p>
<p>In <a href="https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/ff05/bayeshead-5000">&ldquo;BayesHead 5000&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.sr.ithaka.org/people/liam-sweeney/">Liam Sweeney</a> imagines a customer service letter from the future. The report it appears in focused on probabilistic programming, which makes advanced statistical techniques more accessible to a broad programming audience. The story imagines a future where those techniques are made personally available via a brain implant (for a price).</p>
<p>A big part of the fun of the story is piecing together the kind of world it takes place in through the euphemistic sales-speak of the service representative. It&rsquo;s a good reminder that whatever fantastical technologies we may invent, we&rsquo;ll still probably relate to one another in the same annoyingly convoluted ways.</p>
<p>The story is inspired by <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/06/21/i-can-speak">George Saunders&rsquo; &ldquo;I Can Speak&rdquo;</a>. Saunders is an expert at revealing (often through an unreliable narrator) the absurdity of conventions and systems that we take for granted. Hopefully, stories like these help us remember not to view the systems that develop around new capabilities as inevitable, but rather as things we are all involved in making – things for which we are collectively responsible.</p>
<h2 id="the-definition-of-success">The Definition of Success</h2>
<p><img src="https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/ff06-scifi-04-411413ee4b6211655a62558808684045.svg" alt="A table showing the ship computer&rsquo;s decision making process. The success prediction is shown to be most influenced by the potential profit for the mission."></p>
<p><a href="https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/ff06/the-definition-of-success">The Definition of Success</a> appears in our report on interpretability, which focuses on techniques for making deep learning models more interpretable. The story takes its inspiration very directly from the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)">Alien</a>. Alien is already the story of uninterpretable AI (the ship computer, Mother). My main additions were imagining an interpretability interface, similar to the prototype we built to accompany the report, that revealed the features underlying the ship&rsquo;s decisions. Based on this information, the protagonist is able to adjust the AI to provide more survival-oriented advice.</p>
<p>Like &ldquo;BayesHead 5000&rdquo;, the story highlights the degree to which larger economic and political systems direct the use of technology. It is not the story of an AI gone rogue. The ship has simply inherited the value system of its owner, Space Exploitation Corp. It is working as designed. Hopefully the story makes the point that interpretability is necessary not just in Matrix-style machine revolt situations, but also to make sure human-controlled systems are not acting contrary to basic decency.</p>
<h2 id="customers-who-havent-read-kafka-also-like">Customers Who Haven&rsquo;t Read Kafka Also Like</h2>
<p><img src="https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/ff07-scifi-01-18d681c9b2c91b1ac2944c7c0ed7dfa0.svg" alt="A computer in a high-rise office buildings. Two plants surround the computer.Its screen reads &ldquo;Customers Who Haven&rsquo;t Read Kafka Also Like&rdquo;."></p>
<p>The <a href="https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/ff07/customers-who-havent-read-kafka-also-like">most recent story</a>, by <a href="http://kentszlauderbach.com/">Kent Szlauderbach</a>, is inspired by Franz Kafka&rsquo;s <a href="http://home.nwciowa.edu/firth/kafka.htm">&ldquo;An Imperial Message&rdquo;</a>. The story appeared in our report on Semantic Recommendations, which looked at building systems that used deep learning to consider the content of an item when making recommendations. Kafka is another writer interested in how we relate to the systems that surround us, making his work an excellent starting point for examining how we relate to algorithmic recommendations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The message,&rdquo; in both the Kafka story and this one, can never be delivered. The story invokes the possibility that we could capture and quantify the true meaning of a story (&ldquo;Say the most powerful computer in the nation sends a message, in a fatal error, containing the story’s true meaning to you, a modest user&rdquo;), only to keep withdrawing that message outside our reach. For me, there&rsquo;s a Zen koan thing happening, where the desire to pin down a fixed meaning is repeatedly denied, and through that I&rsquo;m forced to reflect on why that denial makes me uncomfortable. The desire to quantify and classify on a large scale is a driving force behind the technology we develop. This story helps me recognize that desire in myself and think about its limits.</p>
<h2 id="a-continuing-conversation">A continuing conversation</h2>
<p>One thing I really like about the last three stories all having pretty direct influences on which they are based is that it shows how stories continue to be relevant in helping us think through the technology and systems that surround us. They&rsquo;re part of a conversation that stretches back to (at least) Kafka writing at the beginning of the 20th century. As Annalee Newitz and Charlie Jane Anders discuss on the third episode of their excellent <a href="https://www.ouropinionsarecorrect.com/the-podcast/">Our Opinions Are Correct podcast</a>, sci-fi books that stand the test of time continue to be relevant not because of the precision of their predictions, but because they meaningfully engage with how we relate to technology as individuals and as a society. These stories are a part of that larger conversation.</p>

    Automatic summarization is a task in which a machine distills a large amount of data into a subset (the summary) that retains the most relevant and important information from the whole. While traditionally applied to text, automatic summarization can include other formats such as images or audio. In this article we’ll cover the main approaches to automatic text summarization, talk about what makes for a good summary, and introduce Summarize. &ndash; a summarization prototype we built that showcases several automatic summarization techniques.

    In extractive summarization, the task is to identify a subset of text (e.g., sentences) from a document that can then be assembled into a summary. Overall, we can treat extractive summarization as a recommendation problem. That is, given a query, recommend a set of sentences that are relevant. The query here is the document, relevance is a measure of whether a given sentence belongs in the document summary.
How we go about obtaining this measure of relevance varies (a common dilemma for any recommendation system).

    The Gensim library is a staple of the NLP stack. While it primarily focuses on topic modeling and similarity for documents, it also supports several word embedding algorithms, including what is likely the best-known implementation of Word2Vec.
Word embedding models like Word2Vec use unlabeled data to learn vector representations for each token in a corpus. These embeddings can then be used as features in myriad downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or recommendation systems.

The machine learning life cycle is more than data + model = API. We know there is a wealth of subtlety and finesse involved in data cleaning and feature engineering. In the same vein, there is more to model-building than feeding data in and reading off a prediction. ML model building requires thoughtfulness both in terms of which metric to optimize for a given problem, and how best to optimize your model for that metric!

  <div class="small">Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of a target domain change overtime causing model performance to degrade. Drift detection is generally achieved by monitoring a performance metric of interest and triggering a retraining pipeline when that metric falls below some designated threshold. However, this approach assumes ample labeled data is available at prediction time - an unrealistic constraint for many production systems. In this report, we explore various approaches for dealing with concept drift when labeled data is not readily accessible.</div>

  <div class="small">Being able to recommend an item of interest to a user (based on their past preferences) is a highly relevant problem in practice. A key trend over the past few years has been session-based recommendation algorithms that provide recommendations solely based on a user’s interactions in an ongoing session, and which do not require the existence of user profiles or their entire historical preferences. This report explores a simple, yet powerful, NLP-based approach (word2vec) to recommend a next item to a user. While NLP-based approaches are generally employed for linguistic tasks, here we exploit them to learn the structure induced by a user’s behavior or an item’s nature.</div>

  <div class="small">Text classification can be used for sentiment analysis, topic assignment, document identification, article recommendation, and more. While dozens of techniques now exist for this fundamental task, many of them require massive amounts of labeled data in order to be useful. Collecting annotations for your use case is typically one of the most costly parts of any machine learning application. In this report, we explore how latent text embeddings can be used with few (or even zero) training examples and provide insights into best practices for implementing this method.</div>
