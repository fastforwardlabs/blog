    <h1>Snorkel: Rapid Training Data Creation with Weak Supervision</h1>
    <p>Machine learning (and more specifically, deep learning) techniques are recognized for their ability to obtain high accuracy for
a variety of classification problems. Deep learning models are more complex than most traditional models and often have
thousands of parameters and commensurately require more labeled training data. Obtaining this data can be an expensive and time-consuming process, and often requires domain experts to help with the labeling process. Many areas of machine learning that are motivated by this bottleneck could be broadly categorized into four areas: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3019233">active learning</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1841234">semi-supervised learning</a>, <a href="https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2017/07/16/weak-supervision/">weak supervision</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5288526/">transfer learning</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10160">Snorkel</a> belongs to the <em>weak supervision</em> class and is effective for tasks like natural language processing. The basic idea is to allow users to provide supervision at a higher level than case-by-case labeling, and then to use various statistical techniques to deal with the noisier labels that are obtained. Working with domain experts, the Snorkel team has found that this type of supervision is easier and faster to provide. And surprisingly, by getting large volumes of lower-quality supervision in this way, one can train higher-quality models at a fraction of the time and cost.</p>
<p>Snorkel is a system built around the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly">data programming</a> paradigm for rapidly creating, modeling, and managing training data. It lets one use weak supervision sources like heuristics, external knowledge bases, crowdsourced labels, and more. These are called weak supervision sources because they may be limited in accuracy and coverage. All of these get combined in a principled manner to produce a set of
probability-weighted labels. The end model is then trained on the generated labels.</p>
<h5 id="snorkel-workflow">Snorkel workflow</h5>
<p><img src="/images/editor_uploads/2018-09-05-182818-snorkel_workflow.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Snorkel&rsquo;s workflow has three main stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Writing Labeling Functions</strong>: Instead of hand-labeling large quantities of training data, users write labeling functions
which capture patterns-based heuristics, connect with external knowledge bases (distant supervision), and so on. A labeling
function is a Python method which, given an input, can either output a label or abstain. For instance, we can write a labeling function that checks if the word “causes” appears between the chemical and disease mentions. If it does, it outputs <em>True</em> if the chemical mention is first and <em>False</em> if the disease mention is first. If “causes” does not appear, it outputs <em>None</em>, indicating abstention. In addition, Snorkel includes a number of declarative labeling functions that can be used out of the box.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="example-labeling-function">Example labeling function</h5>
<p><img src="/images/editor_uploads/2018-09-05-182951-labeling_function.png" alt="">
2. <strong>Modeling Accuracies and Correlations</strong>: Next, Snorkel automatically learns a generative model over the labeling functions, which allows it to estimate their accuracies and correlations. This step uses no ground-truth data, learning instead from the agreements and disagreements of the labeling functions.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Training a Discriminative Model</strong>: The output of Snorkel is a set of probabilistic labels that can be used to train a
wide variety of state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as popular deep learning models. While the generative model is
essentially a re-weighted combination of the user-provided labeling functions — which tend to be precise but low-coverage - discriminative models can retain this precision while learning to generalize beyond the labeling functions, increasing
coverage and robustness on unseen data.</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing to note is that it is quite possible for a user to write labeling functions that are statistically dependent (i.e., correlated). Modeling such dependencies is crucial because it affects the estimates of true labels. To help with this, Snorkel automatically selects which dependencies to model using an estimator that relies on a hyper-parameter - epsilon. With large values of epsilon, no correlations are included, and as we reduce the value progressively more correlations are added, starting with the strongest.</p>
<p>Snorkel is currently being used on text extraction applications for medical records at the Deparment of Veterans Affairs, to mine scientific literature for adverse drug reactions in collaboration with the Federal Drug Administration, and to comb through everything from surgical reports to after-action combat reports for valuable structured data.

    In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase. Recently, our team at Fast Forward Labs have been exploring state of the art models for Question Answering and have used the rather excellent HuggingFace transformers library.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    Welcome to the first edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward blog on Natural Language Processing for Question Answering! Throughout this series, we’ll build a Question Answering (QA) system with off-the-shelf algorithms and libraries and blog about our process and what we find along the way. We hope to wind up with a beginning-to-end documentary that provides:

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

  <div class="small">Interpretability, or the ability to explain why and how a system makes a decision, can help us improve models, satisfy regulations, and build better products. Black-box techniques like deep learning have delivered breakthrough capabilities at the cost of interpretability. In this report, recently updated to include techniques like SHAP, we show how to make models interpretable without sacrificing their capabilities or accuracy.</div>
