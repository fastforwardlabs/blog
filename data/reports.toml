name = "Inferring Concept Drift Without Labeled Data"
blurb = "Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of a target domain change overtime causing model performance to degrade. Drift detection is generally achieved by monitoring a performance metric of interest and triggering a retraining pipeline when that metric falls below some designated threshold. However, this approach assumes ample labeled data is available at prediction time - an unrealistic constraint for many production systems. In this report, we explore various approaches for dealing with concept drift when labeled data is not readily accessible."

name = "Session-based Recommender Systems"
blurb = "Being able to recommend an item of interest to a user (based on their past preferences) is a highly relevant problem in practice. A key trend over the past few years has been session-based recommendation algorithms that provide recommendations solely based on a user’s interactions in an ongoing session, and which do not require the existence of user profiles or their entire historical preferences. This report explores a simple, yet powerful, NLP-based approach (word2vec) to recommend a next item to a user. While NLP-based approaches are generally employed for linguistic tasks, here we exploit them to learn the structure induced by a user’s behavior or an item’s nature."

name = "Few-Shot Text Classification"
blurb = "Text classification can be used for sentiment analysis, topic assignment, document identification, article recommendation, and more. While dozens of techniques now exist for this fundamental task, many of them require massive amounts of labeled data in order to be useful. Collecting annotations for your use case is typically one of the most costly parts of any machine learning application. In this report, we explore how latent text embeddings can be used with few (or even zero) training examples and provide insights into best practices for implementing this method."

This report examines generalized additive models, which give us a simple, flexible, and interpretable means for modeling time series by decomposing them into structural components. We look at the benefits and trade-offs of taking a curve-fitting approach to time series, and demonstrate its use via Facebook’s Prophet library on a demand forecasting problem."

blurb = "In contrast to how humans learn, deep learning algorithms need vast amounts of data and compute and may yet struggle to generalize. Humans are successful in adapting quickly because they leverage their knowledge acquired from prior experience when faced with new problems. In this report, we explain how meta-learning can leverage previous knowledge acquired from data to solve novel tasks quickly and more efficiently during test time"

Black-box techniques like deep learning have delivered breakthrough capabilities at the cost of interpretability. In this report, recently updated to include techniques like SHAP, we show how to make models interpretable without sacrificing their capabilities or accuracy."

This report focuses on active learning, a technique that relies on collaboration between machines and humans to label smartly. Active learning reduces the number of labeled examples required to train a model, saving time and money while obtaining comparable performance to models trained with much more data. With active learning, enterprises can leverage their large pool of unlabeled data to open up new product possibilities."
