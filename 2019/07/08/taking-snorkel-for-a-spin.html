    <h1>Taking Snorkel for a spin</h1>
    <p>Active learning, which we explored in our <a href="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/04/02/a-guide-to-learning-with-limited-labeled-data.html">report on <em>Learning with Limited
Labeled Data</em></a>, makes it possible to build machine learning models with a small
set of labeled data. The typical simplified workflow when tackling a supervised
machine learning problem is to i) locate the data, ii) create labels for all
available data (the more the merrier), and iii) build a model. Instead of
labeling all available data, active learning takes advantage of collaboration
between humans and machines to smartly pick a small subset of data to be
labeled. A machine learning model is then built using this small subset of data.</p>
<p>At the heart of active learning is the ability to identify difficult
datapoints. Once identified, a human steps in to provide <em>precise, high quality</em>
labels. But instead of asking a human to provide labels, can we write a function to
programmatically create the labels? It turns out that the function that we are able to
write does not always do a good job of labeling complex classification problems -
the labeling function is typically based on heuristics and guesses. A single
labeling function then, is not powerful enough. But what if we combine many such
functions, and use the agreements and disagreements between them to figure out what
the most likely label is; would that work?</p>
<p>This is the premise of <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/snorkel">Snorkel</a> - a weak supervision framework.</p>
<h3 id="the-general-idea-of-snorkel">The general idea of Snorkel</h3>
<p><img src="/images/2019/07/snorkel_overview-1562618731259.png" alt="Overview of Snorkel"></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the components of Snorkel. To use Snorkel, one first needs
to define a candidate. This represents the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; we are attempting to
label. If we are trying to label whether a relationship exists between two
persons, a candidate is a pair of persons. If we are trying to predict sentiment
of a movie review, a candidate is just the movie review itself. The preprocessing
step for Snorkel then, is to extract all possible candidates from our
unlabeled data.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">
<span style="color:#75715e"># An example of a candidate for predicting movie sentiment</span>
Review <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> candidate_subclass(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;Review&#39;</span>, [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;review&#39;</span>])

</code></pre></div><p>Once we have these candidates, we split them into test, train, and validation
sets, as we normally do. At this point, we are ready to write labeling
functions. Each labeling function takes in a candidate, and uses heuristics to
determine a label. In the binary classification example, the labeling function
outputs a 1 (positive), -1 (negative), or 0 (abstain - the labeling function
chooses not to label). To label if a relationship exists between two persons, we
might look for the word <em>spouse</em> between the person names. To label movie review
sentiment, we might look for the word <em>horrible</em> in the review in order to
create a negative label. These labeling functions do not need to be precise, and
we should write many of them. We can also include labels from crowdsourcing
results, knowledge bases, and weak classifiers.  We collect all labeling
functions, and apply them to each candidate. This will give us a matrix of
labels; the size of the matrix is <em>number of candidates</em> x <em>number of labeling
functions</em>.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The next step is to train a generative model using this large matrix of
labels. The generative model is just a probability distribution over the latent
variable (the unobservable true label, since our data is unlabeled). The
generative model estimates the accuracy of the labeling function while automatically
taking into account the pairwise correlation between these functions and labeling
propensity (how often a function actually creates a label). Once the model is
trained, it can be used to estimate the true label for each candidate. These
labels are numbers between 0 and 1, representing the probability of a positive
class, and are known as <em>probabilistic labels</em>.</p>
<p>So far, we haven&rsquo;t had to use any actual labels (gold labels) yet. Although we
can get to the generative model without them, having a small set of labeled data
is helpful for refining and iterating over the labeling functions. Once the
generative model is trained, we can i) create a label matrix on the validation
dataset using all labeling functions, ii) use the generative model on this label
matrix to get a set of probabilistic labels, and iii) perform error analysis
(precision, recall, F1 scores) by comparing to the gold labels.</p>
<p>Iterating this way implies that our labeling functions can overfit to the
validation dataset. Hence, the last step is to feed the probabilistic labels into
a discriminative model, which generalizes beyond the information expressed in
the labeling functions, and typically increases recall (the proportion of actual
positive labels that were identified correctly). We also want the discriminative
model to learn more from high-confidence training labels rather than treating
the noisy probabilistic labels as ground truth. This just means that the loss
function should be the cross-entropy loss between the probabilistic labels and
the output of a logistic function. See <a href="https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/dp_with_tf_blog_post.html">Step 3 for
derivation</a>. In
Tensorflow, this can be computed using tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-we-need-a-generative-model">Why do we need a generative model?</h3>
<p>We could have just used majority voting - the correct label is the one that has
the most votes from all the labeling functions. This approach does not capture
correlation, redundancy, and other more complex information hidden in the
labeling matrix. Imagine the <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/papers/Chris_Re-KDD.pdf">following
scenario</a> where you
have two labeling functions - a high accuracy function which created labels for
ten thousand data points, and a low accuracy function which created labels for
one million datapoints. Given the two different labeling propensities, what is the
right way to combine them? The generative model weights these functions
accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="using-snorkel-to-classify-complaints">Using Snorkel to classify complaints</h3>
<p>The idea of building a generative model that can tease out complex hidden
relationships between labeling functions in order to create a set of
probabilistic labels sounds very appealing. Instead of just reading about the
approach, we used Snorkel to build a complaint classifier using data from
<a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/">Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau</a>. See
our <a href="https://experiments.fastforwardlabs.com/">notebook</a> for details.</p>
<h3 id="practical-considerations">Practical Considerations</h3>
<p>Our experience with Snorkel taught us a few things.</p>
<p>The Snorkel project is active and ongoing. The <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/snorkel/tree/master/tutorials">code
examples</a> are of
immense help, but as with most machine learning packages, there is a learning
curve for first-time users. The current state of documentation makes it most
suitable for developer data scientists who can explore the nuts and bolts of the
underlying code.</p>
<p>Specific to work flow, after using Snorkel to build the generative model, one
has a choice of a) using existing noise-aware discriminative models in Snorkel&rsquo;s
library to train a classifier or b) export the probabilistic training labels and
use it to train any other model (PyTorch or scikit-learn model, for
example). Choosing b) implies that the model needs to be able to handle
probabilistic training labels. In addition, the candidates within Snorkel need
to be converted into a format that works with the model. Our experiment used the
first approach, but we could have made the second approach work relatively
quickly.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of using Snorkel in production, the data scientists need to
first set up a Snorkel pipeline. This includes defining candidates, creating a
few labeling functions, training the generative model, setting up the framework
to iterate on labeling functions, and defining the discriminative model. Once
this is in place, subject matter experts (SMEs) need to be taught to write
labeling functions. Alternatively, SMEs can work together with data scientists
to transfer any domain knowledge (including rules or patterns to look for) that
will help create labeling functions. These functions generate either positive or
negative labels (in the binary classification case) and at times abstain from
labeling; they should perform better than a random label generator.</p>
<p>Snorkel has two more major advantages in addition to the ability to incorporate
human domain expertise. First, it is good for fast and flexible label
generation. In essence, when using Snorkel one can think of training data as &ldquo;a
collection of labeling functions.&rdquo; If and when the training goal changes, a
quick rewrite or modification of those labeling functions will put you back on
track. It is also easy to adjust labels since we can quickly modify the labeling
function itself. A nice side effect of creating labeling functions is that the
classification problem becomes a little more interpretable!</p>
<p>Another advantage of Snorkel is that less precise and low quality labels can now
be used. Instead of discarding low quality crowdsourced labels, we can now
include them in the large label matrix and rely on the generative model to tease
out useful information (although more labeling functions imply longer training
times for the generative model). Intuitively, learning the generative model’s
parameters is possible when we have sufficient better-than-random weak
supervision sources available. Having enough sources allows one to better
estimate the true (latent) class labels.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Snorkel and active learning both attempt to enable learning with limited labeled
data. Active learning introduces human expertise into the loop to smartly label a
small set of data; Snorkel removes humans from the labeling process, but finds a
way to smartly combine a large number of noisy, low quality - and, in some cases -
automatically generated labels (albeit retaining human domain
knowledge). Snorkel provides an interesting take, and leaves us wondering if
large fleets of human annotators will be replaced ultimately by a small set of
&ldquo;labeling function creators&rdquo; who have domain expertise.</p>

    Given a question and a passage, the task of Question Answering (QA) focuses on identifying the exact span within the passage that answers the question.
Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.
