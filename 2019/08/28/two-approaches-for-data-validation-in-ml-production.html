    <h1>Two approaches for data validation in ML production</h1>
    <p>Machine learning models start to deteriorate once we deploy them. This is partly
because real life data changes, and models need to be re-trained to maintain
their performance. Typical ML pipelines re-train periodically (daily, for
example) using newly available data. But how do we validate data fed into the
pipelines to make sure tainted data does not accidentally sneak into the
production system? Tainted data could cause system crashes or lead to slow
degradation of model performance. The impact of the former is painful and
immediate; the impact of the latter is perhaps more dreaded. It&rsquo;s hard to
debug and isolate.</p>
<h3 id="unit-tests-for-datasets">Unit-tests for datasets</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1781-schelter.pdf">Amazon research (PDF)</a>
proposed a unit-test approach. The idea is to create a system that (i) allows
users to (easily) define constraints (or checks) on the data, (ii) converts these
constraints to computable metrics, and (iii) reports which constraints succeeded
and failed, and the metric value that triggered a failure.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019/07/amzn_constraint-1562965509938.png" alt=""></p>
<h5 id="example-constraints-image-sourcehttpwwwvldborgpvldbvol11p1781-schelterpdf">Example constraints (<a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1781-schelter.pdf">image source</a>)</h5>
<p>How does it work? Imagine some data as a set of log files generated by an
on-demand video platform. The log contains information about platform usage,
type of device, length of session, title, and customer id. This is ingested and
used as training data for recommendation systems. To validate this data using
the proposed system, the user defines a set of checks including (i) <em>completeness</em>
and <em>consistency</em> (for example: <em>customerID</em> and <em>title</em> columns should have no
missing values), (ii) <em>uniqueness</em> (for example: each row of combined <em>customerID</em>
and <em>title</em> value should be unique), and (iii) <em>counting</em> (for example: number of
distinct values in the <em>title</em> column should be less than the total number of
movies in the system). Once the constraints are specified, the system converts
them into actual computable metrics. For example, <em>completeness</em> would convert
into a &ldquo;fraction of non-missing values in a column&rdquo; metric. The last step is to
generate a report to show how all the constraints fared. The report also lists
the ones that failed, along with the value that triggered a failure.</p>

<h5 id="system-architecture-image-sourcehttpwwwvldborgpvldbvol11p1781-schelterpdf">System architecture (<a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1781-schelter.pdf">image source</a>)</h5>
<p>Because new data comes in continously, the system uses a recursive computation
approach that only looks at <em>new data since the last time step</em> to update the
metrics incrementally. In addition, to lower the barrier of adoption, the system
automatically suggests constraints for datasets. This is accomplished through
clever use of heuristics and a machine learning model.</p>
<p>The heuristics approach employs single-column profiling - all the user needs to provide is a single
table dataset with column names to start. The system then executes single column
profiling in three passes; the goal is to figure out data size, data type,
summary statistics (min, max, mean, etc.) and frequency distribution of the
data. Based on the profiling results, the system recommends constraints based on
a set of heuristics. For example, if a column is complete, the system suggests
an <em>isComplete</em> constraint. If the number of distinct values in a column is
below a threshold, the column is assumed to be categorical and the system
suggests an <em>isInRange</em> constraint that checks whether future values are
contained in the set of already observed values. The heuristic approach is
complemented by a machine learning model. The model is trained to predict
constraints based on table name, column name, and type. Finally, the system
performs anomaly detection on historic time series of data quality metrics (for
example: the ratio of missing values for different versions of a dataset). This
can be done using either built-in or user-provided algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="data-schema-applied-to-ml">Data Schema applied to ML</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sysml.cc/doc/2019/167.pdf">a separate paper (PDF)</a>, Google
introduced a similar system, but one that relies on the concept of data schema
to codify expectations for correct data. The system integrates into existing ML
pipelines right after training data ingestion - training data is validated
before being piped into a training algorithm. This system consists of three main
components: a <em>Data Analyzer</em> that computes a predefined set of statistics that
is considered sufficient to describe the data, a <em>Data Validator</em> that checks
the data against a Schema, and a <em>Model Unit Tester</em> that checks for errors in
the training code using synthetic data generated through the schema. The system
can (i) detect anomalies in a single batch of data, (ii) detect significant
changes between successive batches of training data, and (iii) find assumptions
in the training code that are not reflected in the data (for example: taking the
log of a feature that turns out to be a negative number).</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019/07/goog_system-1562965719123.png" alt=""></p>
<h5 id="system-architecture-image-sourcehttpswwwsysmlccdoc2019167pdf">System architecture (<a href="https://www.sysml.cc/doc/2019/167.pdf">image source</a>)</h5>
<p>In simple terms, a schema is just a <em>logical</em> model of the data. Because machine learning data typically
consists of features, the schema would have a collection of features, and the
constraints associated with each. These constraints include basic properties
(for example: type, domain) and ML relevant ones. For example, we want a
<em>presence</em> constraint to make sure features are not accidentally dropped. We
also want a <em>domain</em> constraint to make sure country codes are always
represented by upper-case strings. To overcome the adoption hurdle (constructing
a schema manually is tedious!), a basic version of the schema is sythesized
based on all available data in the pipeline by relying on a set of reasonable
heuristics.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019/07/goog_schema-1562965821479.png" alt=""></p>
<h5 id="schema-example-image-sourcehttpswwwsysmlccdoc2019167pdf">Schema example (<a href="https://www.sysml.cc/doc/2019/167.pdf">image source</a>)</h5>
<p>Once we have the schema in place, the <em>Data Validator</em> validates each batch of
data by comparing it against the schema. Any disagreement is flagged and sent
over to a human for further investigation. In addition, the <em>Data Validator</em>
also recommend updates to the schema as new data is ingested and analyzed. Users
can easily apply or edit the suggested changes using a click-button interface.</p>
<p>Some anomalies only manifest when we look across multiple batches rather than
focusing on a single batch in isolation. Distribution skew, for example, occurs when
the distribution of feature values of a batch of training data is different from
that seen at serving time. To detect this type of anomaly, the system relies on
metrics that can quantify the distance between the training and serving
distributions. Metrics such as KL divergence or cosine similarity can be used,
but they rely on setting a threshold; anything that crosses the threshold is
considered an anomaly. Unfortunately, this threshold needs to be tuned, and
product teams have a hard time building intuition for what this threshold
actually means. The proposed system thus uses a different metric that comes with
a natural interpretation: it sets the largest allowed change (in probability)
for a particular value. With this metric, teams can say &ldquo;allow changes of up to
1% for each value&rdquo; rather than having to a set an obscure threhold for KL
divergence.</p>
<p>Lastly, the system builds in model unit testing - it catches mismatches between
the expected data and the assumptions made in the training code. Imagine a
scenario where the training code applies a log computation on a numeric
feature. This implies that the feature&rsquo;s value is always positive, but if the
schema does not encode this assumption, how do we catch this type of error? The
proposed system uses a <em>fuzz testing</em> approach. First, synthetic training
examples that adhere to the schema constraints are generated. Second, this
generated data is used to drive a few iterations of the training code. The goal
is to trigger hidden assumptions in the code that do not agree with schema
constraints.</p>
<p>Both approaches are used in actual production systems at Amazon and Google and
seem to be impactful. As enterprises put more machine learning models into
production, monitoring the quality of data that feeds into these models becomes
even more important. <a href="https://www.sysml.cc/doc/2019/167.pdf">Data needs to be elevated to a first-class citizen in ML
pipelines</a>, and not just in the model
development stage!</p>

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    Welcome to the first edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward blog on Natural Language Processing for Question Answering! Throughout this series, we’ll build a Question Answering (QA) system with off-the-shelf algorithms and libraries and blog about our process and what we find along the way. We hope to wind up with a beginning-to-end documentary that provides:

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

    Why do privacy and governance matter? Data privacy has been a common conversation topic among the general public since the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. The data &ldquo;breach,&rdquo; in which user information was hoovered up through a Facebook quiz and subsequently misrepresented as being used for academic purposes, resulted in over $5 billion in fines for Facebook. However, Facebook&rsquo;s infringements were, in fact, relatively narrow in scope (though nonetheless egregious) compared to the growing remit of privacy law.

  <div class="small">Interpretability, or the ability to explain why and how a system makes a decision, can help us improve models, satisfy regulations, and build better products. Black-box techniques like deep learning have delivered breakthrough capabilities at the cost of interpretability. In this report, recently updated to include techniques like SHAP, we show how to make models interpretable without sacrificing their capabilities or accuracy.</div>
