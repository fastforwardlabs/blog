    <h1>The trouble with unexplainable algorithms</h1>
    <p>Thanks to a mix of technology-driven disruption and savvy competitors, the business environment is an increasingly challenging one. Staying competitive requires a better understanding of customers’ behaviour and preferences. It also requires the ability to optimise internal processes to more efficiently support both these things. This is a big reason that so many organisations are investing in machine learning.</p>
<p>And yet the use of machine learning in organisations has not been universally welcomed by customers and service users. In fact, in some areas, there’s been a growing push back &ndash; or ‘techlash,’ as it has been dubbed. People have expressed concern about a range of things: the breadth of data being collected and the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/millions-people-uploaded-photos-ever-app-then-company-used-them-n1003371">terms</a> of its use, as well as the types of decisions being recommended or made by the algorithms trained on this data. The sources of concern vary, but a lack of trust is the common denominator.</p>
<h3 id="the-trust-deficit">The trust deficit</h3>
<p>One corollary of this trust deficit is an increasingly adversarial relationship between organisations and their service users and customers. Lately, I have been thinking about this a lot. It was definitely on my mind when I read about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/21/office-worker-launches-uks-first-police-facial-recognition-legal-action">legal action</a> that Ed Bridges has brought against the South Wales police for violating his privacy through their facial recognition trial. Bridges, who is a private citizen, is doing this with the support of <a href="https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/news/press-releases-and-statements/liberty-client-takes-police-ground-breaking-facial-recognition">Liberty HQ</a> . This is the first case of its kind in the UK, and it comes hard on the heels of San Francisco city legislature’s <a href="https://text.npr.org/s.php?sId=723193785">decision</a> to ban the use of facial recognition by police and city agencies. Oakland and Massachusetts are also considering similar legislation:</p>
<p>_“Big Sister is watching us,&rdquo; [says Senate Majority Leader, Cynthia Creem], &ldquo;and yet we don&rsquo;t even know how those pictures are being used &hellip; The system that they&rsquo;re using now raises issues of due process and significant issues with regards to civil liberties.&rdquo; _<a href="https://text.npr.org/s.php?sId=723193785">(NPR.org)</a></p>
<p>These are widely reported examples of techlash, but they’re on the same spectrum as smaller scale adversarial action against algorithmically-driven decision-making. This latter behaviour was a topic of discussion in a recent <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/sleepwalkers/poker-face-bSmrcn6E1H4/">episode</a> of the tech podcast, Sleepwalkers. <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/institute-management-studies/staff/moretti-lisa/">Lisa Talia Moretti</a>, a guest on the show, <a href="https://lnns.co/0lIJtPjDcOf/371">spoke</a> about students who figured out that a certain selection algorithm prioritised applications from students from universities such as Harvard, Oxford, or Cambridge. They started writing the names of these universities in white text (so human recruiters couldn’t pick up on it) on their CVs, in order to dupe the algorithm.</p>
<p><img src="/images/editor_uploads/2019-06-07-135738-helloquence_51716_unsplash.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h5 id="image-source--helloquencehttpsunsplashcomhelloquenceutm_sourceunsplashutm_mediumreferralutm_contentcreditcopytext-on-unsplashhttpsunsplashcom">Image Source:  <a href="https://unsplash.com/@helloquence?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Helloquence</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></h5>
<p>Screening out applications from certain candidates may well have been the intent of the organisation(s) using this algorithm. If so, it’s surprising that the human recruiters <em>didn’t</em> immediately pick up on the fact that applications from less desirable candidates were getting through - in which case, they could have simply screened them out at a subsequent stage or been explicit about their preference for candidates from certain universities. My suspicion is that this <em>wasn’t</em> their intention, and that the emergent selection bias or preference was simply a quirk of the algorithm that was left unexplored and unaddressed.</p>
<p>However this state of affairs came about, the low-level adversarial behaviour it has triggered is corrosive - slowly transforming a potentially positive engagement into a grudge interaction.</p>
<h3 id="building-trust-making-friends">Building trust, making friends</h3>
<p>So how <em>do</em> organisations go about (re)building trust and - by extension - resetting the dynamic between themselves and their users/customers? There are some really obvious choices namely, clarity and honesty about the way any collected data will be used, and taking steps to protect that data. In this context, being honest is often a matter of being upfront about business models (in the case of commercial entities) as well as governance and decision-making policies (especially in the case of government), and not trying to sneakily change models and policies through privacy policy updates.</p>
<p>However, achieving the requirement for clarity is a tougher challenge. There are a number of reasons for this, but I will simply touch on two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining how complex systems interact with the various features of a large dataset - in a way that’s easy for time-poor, non-experts to grasp - is hard.</li>
<li>Sometimes,(especially in the case of so-called ‘black box’ models) organisations don’t know quite how their algorithms arrive at the results that they do.</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems are related: explaining the workings of a system you don’t really understand is a tall order. That’s why attaining this understanding should be a critical area of focus for organisations that use machine learning. Thankfully, approaches for doing this are becoming more mature; this was the focus of our <a href="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/08/02/business-interpretability.html">Interpretability</a> research report.  Understanding the way systems work also paves the way for better, and more considered, trust-building conversations with end-users. (If you’re curious about what this looks like in practice, I recommend reading <a href="https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/learning-through-making-understanding-what-young-people-think-about-ai-and-data-privacy/">this blog post</a> about “designing to expose the seams of [automated decision making].” It’s based on a collaboration between the design agencies <a href="https://comuzi.xyz/#">Comuzi</a> and <a href="https://www.projectsbyif.com/">Projects by If</a>.)</p>
<p>With the advent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR), there has  been a lot of focus on explainability as a regulatory requirement. There is great benefit for organisations in recognising the value of interpretability and explainability as tools for building trust with customers.</p>

    Figure 1: Screenshots from a web application we built that allows you to explore semantic search query results, explore a visualization of embeddings and perform live search. Full source code here. TLDR; Good representations of data (e.g. text, images) are critical for solving many tasks (e.g. search or recommendations). Deep representation learning yield state of the art results when used to create these representations. In this article, we review methods for representation learning and walk through an example using pretrained models.

    Given a question and a passage, the task of Question Answering (QA) focuses on identifying the exact span within the passage that answers the question.
Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    Welcome to the first edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward blog on Natural Language Processing for Question Answering! Throughout this series, we’ll build a Question Answering (QA) system with off-the-shelf algorithms and libraries and blog about our process and what we find along the way. We hope to wind up with a beginning-to-end documentary that provides:

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

  <div class="small">In contrast to how humans learn, deep learning algorithms need vast amounts of data and compute and may yet struggle to generalize. Humans are successful in adapting quickly because they leverage their knowledge acquired from prior experience when faced with new problems. In this report, we explain how meta-learning can leverage previous knowledge acquired from data to solve novel tasks quickly and more efficiently during test time</div>
