    <h1>Meta-Learners - learning how to learn</h1>
    <p><a href="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/04/02/a-guide-to-learning-with-limited-labeled-data.html">Active learning</a>
allows us to be smart about picking the right set of datapoints for which to create labels. Done properly, this approach results in models that are trained on less data
performing comparatively to models trained on much more data. In the world of meta-learning, we do not focus on label acquisition; rather, we attempt to build a
machine that learns quickly from a small number of training data.</p>
<p>Training meta-learners is a two-step process involving a <em>learner</em> and a
<em>trainer</em>. The goal of the learner (model) is to quickly learn new tasks from a
small amount of new data; hence, it is sometimes called a <em>fast learner</em>. A task
here refers to any supervised machine learning problem - e.g., predicting a class
given a small number of examples. This learner is trained, by the
meta-learner, to be able to learn from a large number of different tasks. The
meta-learner accomplishes this by repeatedly showing the learner hundreds and
thousands of different tasks. Learning then, happens at two levels. The first
level focuses on quick acquisition of knowledge within each task. The second
level slowly pulls and digests information across all tasks.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019/05/fig2-1558038262452.png" alt="Training meta-learners is a two-step process."></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use a concrete example: our goal is to train a model to classify images
into four classes (cat, bear, fish. and bird), where each class only has a small
number of labeled datapoints. To do so, we first define a learner whose task is to
predict one out of two classes when given three examples of each class. We then
define a meta-learner. Its job is to show many different combinations of any
two classes, each with three examples, to the learner.</p>
<p>In contrast to regular deep learning, where training data is one large labeled
dataset split into batches, the training data for meta-learning is in the form of <em>sets</em>. First we need a set of examples, or a <em>support set</em>. This
consists of a couple of images belonging to a subset of classes. Going back to
our example, a support set could be comprised of three images of cats and three images of
bears. We also need to specify images that we would like to classify; they form
a <em>target set</em>. In our example, a target set would be a set of images of cats or
bears. Together, the support and the target sets form a training episode. The
meta-learner takes many many episodes and shows them to the learner,
episode by episode. The learner&rsquo;s job is to learn to classify the images in the
target set correctly, episode by episode.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019/05/fig1-1558038180094.png" alt="Meta-learning datasets"></p>
<p>Papers in this field often use the notation of <em>k</em> and <em>N</em>, where <em>k</em> represents the
number of opportunities the fast learner is given to learn, and <em>N</em> represents the number of
classes it is required to be able to classify. Our running example,
with <em>N=2</em> and <em>k=3</em>, illustrates a two-way three-shot (N-way, k-shot) meta-learning setting.</p>
<p>Astute readers will notice that while our goal is to train a model to classify four
classes (cat, bear, fish, and bird), each training episode only consist of two
classes. This is a feature of meta-learning. The training procedure for meta-learning, first proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080">Oriol Vinyals in his seminal paper on matching
networks</a> is based on the principle that testing
and training conditions must match. We do not show all classes to the fast learner
at once because we expect the model to predict correctly (during inference) when shown a couple of
images from a small number of classes. In addition, not all
classes are used as training data. In our example, we might just use three classes,
and expect the model to be able to make predictions accurately about the final
class. Meta-learners can do that because they are trained to be able to
generalize to other datasets. Each time the fast learner is shown an episode of
data, it is exposed to a small subset of classes. The meta-learner cycles
through many, many episodes, each exposing the fast learner to a different subset
of classes. As a result, the fast learner not only learns to quickly classify
each subset of classes, it also extracts the commonality and differences across
all the classes.</p>
<h2 id="similarity-between-classes">Similarity between classes</h2>
<p>If you were given a set of example images and were asked to classify a new
image, the natural thing to do would be to compare the new image to the examples, find
the one that is the most similar, and use its class as the new image&rsquo;s
label. This is the idea behind similarity-based approaches. To classify a new
(target) image based on the examples available (the support set), first find its
closest image from the examples, then use that image&rsquo;s label as a prediction. In
matching networks, images are represented by their embeddings, and distance
between images is simply cosine distance between image embeddings. Embeddings,
which we discussed in the context of languages in our <a href="https://www.cloudera.com/products/fast-forward-labs-research/fast-forward-labs-research-reports.html">&ldquo;Summarization&rdquo; and &ldquo;Semantic
Recommendations&rdquo;
reports</a>,
are rich numerical representations of text that a computer can understand. For
images, embeddings can be thought of as a group of features (lines, edges) that
richly represent images. The goal of the matching networks approach, then, is to
converge to embeddings that will result in the following: target image being
closest to the support set image with the correct label.</p>
<p>When an image in the target set belongs to a new unseen class, the matching
network model treats it like any other image. It links the new image to the
closest image in the support set, and uses that image&rsquo;s label as a
prediction. The matching network works with new and unseen classes!</p>
<h2 id="internal-representation">Internal representation</h2>
<p>In essence, the previous approach takes advantage of a <em>distance metric based on
embeddings</em> to compare new images to example images in the support set. The
model is trained such that we can correctly, in a probabilistic sense, link new
images to one of the example images. Post-training, we end up with a model
capable of generating representation of images (through embeddings) that
captures both the difference and commonality between images. This suggests
another approach to teaching machines to learn quickly with little training
data. We start by finding a internal representation that can be adjusted easily
with new tasks; the model can then rapidly adapt to new tasks using only a few
datapoints.</p>
<p>In the context of deep learning, internal representation typically manifests
itself as a set of parameters for the neural network.  A &ldquo;good&rdquo; internal
representation is one that is broadly suitable for many tasks. Small tweaks to
this representation will produce a model that works well for new tasks. These
tweaks are usually performed under the framework of <a href="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2018/09/17/deep-learning-is-easy-an-introduction-to-transfer-learning.html">transfer
learning</a>. Training
the network using a small number of new datapoints while only adjusting weights at the
final layers is an example of a feature extraction using transfer
learning. Larger tweaks, where the entire model (or parameters) are re-trained
using new datapoints is also possible, and is known as fine-tuning.</p>
<p>But where does this magical internal representation come from? In transfer
learning, it is a pre-trained neural network from another task which has ample
training data. Once initialized, the new, small dataset is used to re-train the
network either fully or partially (just the final layers). An alternative way to
arrive at this internal representation is through an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400">initial set of network
parameters</a>. Once the network is initialized
with the right parameters, it becomes quick and easy to adjust using a small
number of new data. This implies that the initial set of network parameters
should be sensitive to changes in the new tasks; small changes in the
parameters will result in large improvements on the loss function of any task.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019/05/sensitivity-1558127068935.png" alt="The optimal initial set of network parameters is sensitive to changes in new tasks."></p>
<p>The general idea behind this approach is the following. We start with a model
and its <em>initial set of parameters</em>. We train this model on a new task using
data from an episode. During training, the initial set of parameters gets
updated; it becomes an <em>updated set of parameters</em>. The goal is to find an
<em>initial set of parameters</em> such that the loss, when measured on the <em>new task,
using the new set of parameters</em>, is small.</p>
<p>This approach is inspired by transfer learning, but while transfer learning
works for moderately sized datasets, it often becomes less effective in cases
where datasets are too small or are too different from the original dataset used
to create the pre-trained network. Optimization approaches in meta learning -
optimizing for a set of initial parameters, or <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJY0-Kcll">optimizing for the model to
converge to a good solution rapidly on each
task</a> - attempt to come up with a
systematic way to learn a common initialization that would serve as a good
starting point for the possibly diverse tasks at hand.</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-meta-learning">The state of meta learning</h2>
<p>Meta-learning is promising because it gets to the heart of the problem of
learning with limited labeled data. Meta-learning, though, requires a different
data collection paradigm. In traditional machine learning, we focus on
collecting many examples of a class. In meta-learning, the focus changes to
collecting many tasks. Indirectly, this implies the need to collect data for
many diverse classes. In our example, we used four classes (cat, bear, fish, and
bird) and defined a task to be &ldquo;predicting one out of two classes when given three
examples each&rdquo;. This gives a maximum of six (four choose two) different tasks and is
obviously insufficient for much learning to happen. Thus, in meta-learning, even
though we do not need many examples of cats, we do need examples of many types
of animals. Further, during inference, support and target sets typically need to
be constructed as well. It is a different type of data requirement (or
constraint) and can be expensive for certain use cases. Even within research,
the datasets are limited to Omniglot and miniImagenet. The Omniglot dataset has
a total of 1623 handwritten characters, each with 20 examples. The miniImageNet
dataset consists of 100 classes from the original ImageNet dataset, each with
600 examples.</p>
<p>Meta-learning is an area that is quickly evolving, but it is not dominated by a
single algorithm. The most promising class of algorithms seems to be based on
optimization approaches; they are inspired by transfer learning and might see
relatively quicker adoption. We expect meta-learning to become more important as
the underlying algorithms become mature, particularly for use cases such as
product classification or rare disease classification, where data exhibits many
classes, but each class merely has a few examples.</p>

    Given a question and a passage, the task of Question Answering (QA) focuses on identifying the exact span within the passage that answers the question.
Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.
