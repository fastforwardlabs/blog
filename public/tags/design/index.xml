      <description>&lt;figure data-orig-width=&#34;600&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;385&#34; class=&#34;tmblr-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://68.media.tumblr.com/8ad092dc44ae1ad68bad697a55274b30/tumblr_inline_o4lon7By6N1ta78fg_540.gif&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-orig-width=&#34;600&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;385&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fast Forward Labs team is putting final touches on our &lt;i&gt;Summarization &lt;/i&gt;research, which explains approaches to making text quantifiable and computable. Stay tuned for a series of resources on the topic, including an online talk May 24 where we’ll cover technical details and survey use cases for financial services, media, and professional services with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.agolo.com/&#34;&gt;Agolo&lt;/a&gt;. Sign up &lt;a href=&#34;https://textsummarizationwebinar.splashthat.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In writing our reports, we try not only to inform readers about the libraries, math, and techniques they can use to put a system into production today, but also the lessons they can learn from historical approaches to a given topic. Turning a retrospective eye towards past work can be particularly helpful when using an algorithm like a &lt;a href=&#34;http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/&#34;&gt;recurrent neural network&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because neural networks are notoriously hard to interpret: feature engineering is left to the algorithm, and involves a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2015/09/24/how-do-neural-networks-learn.html&#34;&gt;complex interplay&lt;/a&gt; between the weight of individual computing nodes and the connections that link them together. In the face of this complexity, it can be helpful to keep former, more simple techniques in mind as a heuristic guide - or model - to shape our intuition about how contemporary algorithms work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, we found that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Peter_Luhn&#34;&gt;H.P. Luhn&lt;/a&gt;’s 1958 paper &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i256/f06/papers/luhn58.pdf&#34;&gt;The Automatic Creation of Literary Abstracts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;provided a simple heuristic to help wrap our heads around the basic steps that go into probabilistic models for summarizing text. (For those interested in history, Luhn also wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://altaplana.com/ibmrd0204H.pdf&#34;&gt;a paper about business intelligence&lt;/a&gt; in 1958 that feels like it could have been written today, as it highlights the growing need to automate information retrieval to manage an unwieldy amount of information.) Our design lead, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GrantCuster&#34;&gt;Grant Custer&lt;/a&gt;, designed a prototype you can play with to walk through Luhn’s method. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/luhn/&#34;&gt;Here’s the link&lt;/a&gt; to access the live demo. Feel free to use the suggested text, or to play around your own (and share results on Twitter!). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We launched a redesign of the Fast Forward Labs website today. There are lots of parts of the design I’d like to write someday about but for this post I want to focus on the thinking behind the “Tech Graph” force-directed graph display in the Intro section.
Dramatizing Information Work The response I want the intro section to provoke is something like: “Wow, there is some really interesting work being done here that I would like to be involved with it.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s restyled blog day here at Fast Forward Labs! Having wrapped up our second report, I (Grant, Fast Forward Labs designer-dev) am now spending some time putting our web presence in order. The real big piece of that is a revamped Fast Forward website, which should be out next week, but as a warm-up today I worked on getting our blog into shape.
I wanted to keep things clean and simple (to go with the grain).</description>

      <description>Our second R&amp;amp;D Report, Probabilistic Methods for Realtime Streams, has gone out! In this report, we explored probabilistic algorithms for machine learning on potentially large realtime streams of data with efficient CPU and memory usage.
Our prototype demonstrated these algorithms running on large amounts of social conversation data. More on that soon.</description>

      <title>We Built a Table</title>

      <description>At Fast Forward Labs we’re thoughtful about the kind of work space we want to spend our time in. We decided that we preferred a shared large table instead of individual desks, to make it easier to collaborate and offer the flexibility to spread out when necessary, and to allow space for other people to drop in and work with us.
We also love to build things, and find an hour of working with our hands to be a welcome respite from hours of math, programming, reading, and writing, so we decided to build it ourselves!</description>
