****Announcing Individual User Subscriptions****

For the past three months at Fast Forward Labs we have been beta-testing a ***subscription option for individuals*** who would love to read our reporting on ***emerging capabilities in machine learning*** and dig further into field even if they're not in a role where their employer is a full-time client.
We found the offering to be a big success with Individual users receiving online access to our ***Reports*** and ***Prototype Libraries***, our weekly original-content ***Newsletter***, a dedicated group ***Slack Channel***, and access to regular ***Online Talks/"Office Hours"*** sessions on technical topics.

While we'd love to have your full companies on-board as Advisory or Workshop clients, we also want to make sure we're helping the data science community to learn and grow. 

So beginning Tuesday, September 5th, we'll be making the individual subscriber option open to everyone!

To sign up, please visit our [website](www.fastforwardlabs.com/subscribe_individual) once the subscription option goes active on the 5th!
We'll look forward to seeing you there!
