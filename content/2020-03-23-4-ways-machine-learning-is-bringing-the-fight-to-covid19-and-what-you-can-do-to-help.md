title: 4 Ways Machine Learning is Bringing the Fight to COVID-19 - and What You Can
  Do To Help
---

As the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold, we're all watching the news with anxiety, uncertainty, and maybe even a little bit of dread. Instead of dwelling on the fearful, I want to focus on what's hopeful. In this article, I'll touch on how machine learning and data science are rising to the challenge. While it would be unrealistic to say that AI will save us from this crisis, it would be equally misguided to think that these techniques can't help at all. There are four big areas where machine learning can make a difference: prediction, diagnostics, cures, and knowledge extraction. Let's briefly examine each area, and then I'll tell you about a few ways that you can get involved, whether or not you have any machine learning experience! 

### Predicting and forecasting

Predicting an epidemic is a challenging prospect; one that was successfully accomplished by a handful of automated surveillance systems including [BlueDot](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/bluedot-used-artificial-intelligence-to-predict-coronavirus-spread.html), [Metabiota](http://metabiota.com/publications#!metabiota-risk-report-no-3-monitoring-and-risk-268), and [HealthMap](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/3/hms-coronavirus-tracking-tool/). These systems use natural language processing and machine learning to perform infectious disease surveillance, and were able to predict the outbreak well before the World Health Organization made its public declaration, providing crucial extra days for preparation and planning. While their sources differ, all of these systems sift through big data from myriad sources — news outlets, airline ticketing, health reports, and social media — from around the globe. However, as the virus has continued to spread and misinformation runs rampant, the effectiveness of these models has diminished.  

Predicting how the virus is likely to unfold from here will likely require outbreak forecasting. Forecasting the future of an outbreak is traditionally the realm of epidemiological modeling - mathematical models that project how infectious diseases will progress. These mathematical models are based on a set of assumptions about the population and are used to estimate disease parameters (for example, R0, the reproduction number). With confidant parameters, one can forecast the outcome of infectious spread as well as simulate interventions and treatments. While there have been [some efforts](http://jtd.amegroups.com/article/view/36385/pdf) to use machine learning to generate these predictive models, most have not yet been vetted academically. One of the biggest challenges of using machine learning for pandemic forecasting is that it requires a lot of historical data in lieu of the extensive assumptions that go into traditional models - data that we simply don't yet have for COVID-19.  

### Diagnostics

Machine learning shows much promise in aiding diagnostics. In the past few years, deep learning for medical imaging has seen significant advances and a multitude of [use cases](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/top-5-use-cases-for-artificial-intelligence-in-medical-imaging) - chief among them being the use of CNNs to identify or flag disease in MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays. These techniques are now being applied to CT scans of lung tissue.  [A flurry of preliminary studies](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=gsb40&q=deep%20learning%20CT%20covid&lookup=0&hl=en) have shown initial promise in their ability to identify COVID-19 from viral pneumonia or healthy individuals; however, several challenges remain. First, these findings have not yet been vetted and are thus not appropriate for clinical use. Second, these models are hampered by a lack of data — some of these studies are based on only a few dozen or couple hundred images total — disallowing proper validation of the results. Finally, diagnosing Covid-19 from CT scans, while critical, does not necessarily help with early diagnosis, as many people do not develop symptoms.

### Developing drugs

Another area where machine learning is making waves is in the search for new treatments. There are high hopes that machine learning and deep learning can accelerate the drug discovery process by identifying more promising candidates or by increasing the percentage of candidates that make it through the regulatory process (to date, [no AI-discovered drug has completed the approval process](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03846-0)). On the front lines in this area is [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/computational-predictions-of-protein-structures-associated-with-COVID-19) with the AlphaFold system, which uses deep neural networks to predict properties of proteins from their genetic sequence. DeepMind recently released predictions of three dimensional structures of under-studied proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The hope is that a better understanding of these protein structures will lead to the development of anti-virals or vaccines, though these particular predictions have yet to be experimentally verified.

And DeepMind isn't the only player in this field. A [number of other teams](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/artificial-intelligence/medical-ai/companies-ai-coronavirus) around the world are also using machine learning to sift through thousands of molecules and chemical sequences of both new and old drugs in the search for possible treatments to COVID-19. 

### Knowledge discovery

With such a deluge of research in the past few months, making sense of it all has become another critical challenge. Not only is it crucial to have verifiably reliable information, there is also the need to synthesize that knowledge into actionable insights. The research on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is growing rapidly. The number of papers submitted to academic journals is more than a single individual could possibly read. Even if they could, it would be more challenging still to draw the vital connections between these research ideas, connections that can lead to eureka moments. This is where machine learning comes in. In the last year, advances in natural language processing techniques have resulted in the capability to mine scientific literature, extracting novel connections and relationships in several fields, including [materials science](https://thenewstack.io/ai-makes-new-scientific-discoveries-by-analyzing-old-research-papers/) and [chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00415). It will be crucial to apply these techniques to the mounting literature on SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19. More on this below. 

## How can you help?

Each of us has a part to play in this crisis. In addition to [washing your hands](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/how-to-wash-your-hands-coronavirus.html), practicing [social distancing](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/17/817251610/its-time-to-get-serious-about-social-distancing-here-s-how), sharing your toilet paper hoard (because, seriously, [you have enough](https://howmuchtoiletpaper.com/)), and [donating to charities](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/21/how-you-can-help-during-coronavirus/?arc404=true), here are some other ways you can contribute: 

### [IBM's Call for Code Global Challenge](https://callforcode.org/challenge/)

This developer competition invites innovators to create practical and effective applications in two tracks: the COVID-19 crisis and climate change. On the COVID-19 track, teams are asked to build open source solutions that address one of three areas critical to mitigating the pandemic: crisis communication during an emergency, ways to improve remote learning, and how to inspire cooperative local communities. Teams are required to build their applications with IBM Cloud resources. The winning team will receive $200,000, as well as additional resources from The Linux Foundation, to productionize and deploy their solutions in communities that need the most help.  

### [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)

Compiled by a coalition of leading research groups in association with the White House, CORD-19 is the largest collection of machine-readable coronavirus literature, containing 44,000 scholarly articles with nearly 30k of them including full text.  The goal of this challenge is to apply text mining and natural language processing techniques to understand key challenges relating to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, including questions on risk factors, transmission vectors, possible vaccines, and ethical considerations. This dataset is being updated periodically as additional medical literature becomes available. 

### Help an AI predict the spread

[Vox did a fantastic interview piece with Roni Rosenfeld](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/19/21185686/ai-predicting-coronavirus-spread-forecasting-covid-19), professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, who leads the machine learning department at the Delphi research group - which strives to improve epidemiological forecasting. Dr. Rosenfeld uses machine learning rather than traditional epidemiological forecasting models to predict flu epidemics. Machine learning models require far fewer assumptions but lots more historical data in order to make accurate predictions. In the case of COVID-19, this historical data doesn't yet exist, thus making ML models underperform traditional techniques. However, Dr. Rosenfeld is augmenting the machine learning approach with the "wisdom of the crowds": dozens of people are asked what they think the rest of the flu season (or COVID-19 spread) will look like over a period of several weeks. Individually, each person is a terrible predictor, but with all of their answers combined, the prediction becomes quite good. 

You can help Dr. Rosenfeld and his team predict the spread of COVID-19 even without a background in data science, coding, or machine learning. The CDC has asked for coverage in every state - meaning the more volunteers, the better! Sign up [here](https://delphi.cmu.edu/crowdcast/) if you want to get involved, but know that your answers provide the most benefit when you update them each week, which takes only a few minutes of your time. Besides, what else do you have better to do while on lockdown?
