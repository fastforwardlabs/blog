title: Job Opportunities at Signal
---

We’re excited to partner with Prehype and an international news media organization to develop Signal, a new way to understand and structure large volumes of streaming news and media content. Signal will combine novel data with <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/04/11/new-tools-to-summarize-text.html">emerging algorithms</a>. We're looking for a couple of folks to join the team. Read more below, and if this is interesting to you, get in touch!

## About Signal

At Signal we are building natural language technology to understand and structure large, streaming news and media content to help surface critical, need-to-know information. We take it as a given that consumers are overwhelmed by the amount of news and information being produced every day. As the volume of information has grown, making informed decisions has become increasingly difficult. Our mission is to gather the signal from the noise. We are partnered with a major international news media organization and a team of experts in the machine learning and data science fields at Fast Forward Labs to develop an applied machine learning solution to understand, structure, and personalize the torrent of online news. This means that we will have the opportunity to reach millions of users upon launch.

## Job Description: Lead Data Engineer

### The Role

We are a small team. Everyone will be involved in every part of the product development process from ideation to design, prototyping, planning, and execution. As the lead engineer, you will lead the design and build of a fast, scalable, and durable system to ingest data from multiple, static and streaming data sources—an opportunity to design and build a system from scratch. You will work alongside the lead machine learning engineer to enable easy access to data and to help productionalize machine learning solutions. You have experience with distributed data storage and message-passing systems, you are excited about microservices architecture. While this is a lead role, we are open to candidates with no prior experience leading the development of a machine learning product. We are looking for people who are eager to learn, driven to build amazing products, and enjoy being a part of a small, versatile, innovative team.

The initial phase of the project is a six month engagement. We are open to full time and contract work.

### What we look for

- You really know python. If you know Scala and/or Go, awesome.
- You have experience with distributed data storage solutions (e.g., Hadoop, Spark).
- You have experience with real-time messaging systems (e.g., Kafka, NSQ, RabbitMQ).
- You have sufficient experience with cloud computing services to set up and provide computing resources to the team (e.g., AWS).
- You enjoy the process of iterating on a product to try to get it right. You think creatively about solutions.
- You enjoy being part of a small team.

## Job Description: Lead Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist

### The Role

We are a small team. Everyone will be involved in every part of the product development process from ideation to design, prototyping, planning, and execution. As the lead machine learning engineer/data scientist, you will drive the development of a new data product—machine learning algorithms to cluster news and media content into digestible pieces of information. You will dig into techniques for text summarization and natural language generation (NLG). You will design algorithms for smart alerting to surface content that rises above the continuing chatter of news media streams. You have prior experience with clustering, natural language processing techniques (NLP), and anomaly detection. You enjoy thinking about creative applications of out-of-the-box techniques, and you love developing your own, custom solutions. Ideally, you have experience working in a production environment: you will work alongside the lead data engineer to ship data science solutions and machine learning features to production, you know or are excited to learn how to build algorithms that scale. While this is a lead role, we are open to applicants with no prior experience leading a data science or machine learning team. We are looking for people who are eager to learn, driven to build amazing products, and enjoy being a part of a small, versatile, innovative team.

The initial phase of the project is a six month engagement. We are open to full time and contract work.

### What We look For

You have prior python programming experience, you write clean object-oriented code, and you know how to hack together an API.
You know and have worked with popular, off-the-shelf machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn) and NLP libraries (e.g., nltk) on both structured and unstructured text, and time series data.
You understand the principles behind clustering. If you know and understand hierarchical (agglomerative) clustering techniques, we would be very excited.
You know popular approaches and algorithms for anomaly detection.
You feel comfortable and you have worked with standard NLP tools. Working with us, you’d be excited to expand upon your knowledge (e.g., text summarization, NLG).
You have or you are excited about developing custom machine learning solutions.
You love the process of iterating on a product to try to get it right. You think creatively about solutions.
You enjoy being part of a small team.
