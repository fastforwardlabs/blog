      <description>199  // ... code   -- Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &amp;ldquo;subordinate ..&amp;rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &amp;ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&amp;quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase. Recently, our team at Fast Forward Labs have been exploring state of the art models for Question Answering and have used the rather excellent HuggingFace transformers library.</description>

      <description>A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.</description>

      <description>At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.</description>

      <description>Why do privacy and governance matter? Data privacy has been a common conversation topic among the general public since the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. The data &amp;ldquo;breach,&amp;rdquo; in which user information was hoovered up through a Facebook quiz and subsequently misrepresented as being used for academic purposes, resulted in over $5 billion in fines for Facebook. However, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s infringements were, in fact, relatively narrow in scope (though nonetheless egregious) compared to the growing remit of privacy law.</description>

      <description>Our anomaly detection prototype, Blip, shows how four different algorithms perform at detecting network attacks. Here is a look at some of the design, visualization, and front-end programming decisions that went into it. (For more on the algorithms themselves, check out the prototype section of our report.)
Tomato sorting The concept of an anomaly is easy to visualize: it&amp;rsquo;s something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t look the same. The conceptual simplicity of it actually makes our prototype&amp;rsquo;s job trickier.</description>

 In recent years, we have seen an unprecedented increase in the availability of data in a variety of domains: manufacturing, health care, finance, IT, and others. Applications leverage this data to make informed decisions. This comes with its own set of challenges (and opportunities) when things start to fail; for instance, what happens when a piece of equipment fails or a network suffers from a security vulnerability?</description>

      <description>For the past decade, humans have unknowingly come to depend on Knowledge Graphs on a daily basis. From personalized shopping recommendations to intelligent assistants and user-friendly search results, many of these accepted (and expected) features have come to fruition through the exploitation of knowledge graphs. Despite their longstanding conceptual and practical existence, knowledge graphs were just added to the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies in 2018 and have continued to garner attention as an area of active research and development for their distinct ability to represent real-world relationships.</description>

      <description>Here in the (virtual) Fast Forward lab, we’re currently deep in the topic selection process for FF13. While one or two of our research engineers take the lead for each report, we work through several rounds of discussion and debate about the merits and demerits of topics on our collective radar as a team. Part of that process is dreaming up potential prototype applications.
Our multi-talented designer/dev Grant proposed a prototype: given a block of text, find a relevant quote.</description>

      <description>I have a bit of a cybersecurity background, so a year or two ago I started paying attention to how often data breaches happen - and I noticed something depressing: they happen literally 3+ times each day on average in the United States alone! (For a particularly sobering review check out this blog post.) All that information, your information, is out there, floating through the ether of the internet, along with much of my information: email addresses, old passwords, and phone numbers.</description>

      <description>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks that take graphs as inputs. These models operate on the relational information in data to produce insights not possible in other neural network architectures and algorithms.
While there is much excitement in the deep learning community around GNNs, in industry circles, this is sometimes less so. So, I’ll review a few exciting applications empowered by GNNs.
Overview of Graphs and GNNs A graph (sometimes called a network) is a data structure that highlights the relationships between components in the data.</description>

      <description>While preparing for a recent edition of the Federated Learning talk I often give at conferences, I encountered this tweet, which includes a demonstration of real-time multi-person segmentation on a smartphone.
Some useful terminology here:
 Object detection typically refers to identifying and localising objects (such as people!) in an image, and surrounding them with a bounding box. Object segmentation labels each pixel of the image with a class (for instance: &amp;ldquo;person,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;car,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;cat,&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>What is weak supervision? We recently explored Snorkel, a weak supervision framework for learning when there are limited high-quality labels (see blog post and notebook). To use Snorkel, subject matter experts first write labeling functions to programmatically create labels. Very often these labeling functions attempt to capture heuristics. The labels are then fed into a generative model. The job of the generative model is to estimate the accuracy of the labeling functions while automatically taking into account the pairwise correlation between these functions and labeling propensity (how often a function actually creates a label).</description>

To illustrate how categories shape our thoughts, the philosopher Michel Foucault cites Jorge Luis Borges&amp;rsquo; (made-up) quotation from a &amp;ldquo;certain Chinese encyclopedia,&amp;quot; where it is supposedly written that:
 Animals are divided into: (a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) suckling pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies.</description>

      <description>And no, not this kind of horizon&amp;hellip; (image credit) In a recent newsletter, Alice mused about how evolving views and theories of learning are shaping machine learning research and practice. If you’re an enterprise data scientist you’re very much focused on the practice of machine learning. Limited awareness of what’s shaping the machine learning breakthroughs that you’re trying to apply to real-life problems makes it easy to get locked into certain approaches and to inherit blind spots.</description>

      <description>Machine learning enables us to build systems that can predict the world around us: like what movies we’d like to watch, how much traffic we’ll experience on our morning commute, or what words we’ll type next in our emails.
There are many types of models and tasks. Face detection models transform raw image pixels into high level signals (like the presence and position of eyes, noses, and ears) and then use those signals to locate all faces in an image.</description>

      <description>Research in machine learning has seen some of the biggest and brightest minds of our time - and copious amounts of funding - funneled into the pursuit of better, safer, and more generalizable algorithms. As the field grows, there is vigorous debate around the direction that growth should take (for a less biased take, see here). This week, I give some background on the major algorithm types being researched, help frame aspects of the ongoing debate, and ultimately conclude that there is no single direction to build toward - but that through collaboration, we’ll see advances on all fronts.</description>

      <description>NLP and Transfer Learning Natural language processing just took a leap forward with the release of new high-quality language models combined with transfer learning. As you know, at Cloudera Fast Forward Labs, we have been researching this leap forward and have just finished a new report on the topic.
These new NLP models rely on deep neural networks, which are data hungry and compute intensive to train. Various research groups trained these new models with tremendous amounts of data and compute power.</description>

      <description>Machine learning models start to deteriorate once we deploy them. This is partly because real life data changes, and models need to be re-trained to maintain their performance. Typical ML pipelines re-train periodically (daily, for example) using newly available data. But how do we validate data fed into the pipelines to make sure tainted data does not accidentally sneak into the production system? Tainted data could cause system crashes or lead to slow degradation of model performance.</description>

      <description>We discussed this research as part of our virtual event on Wednesday, July 24th; you can watch the replay here!
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs or ConvNets) excel at learning meaningful representations of features and concepts within images. These capabilities make CNNs extremely valuable for solving problems in the image analysis domain. We can automatically identify defects in manufactured items, reducing costs associated with quality assurance processes; we can now infer depth information and reconstruct 3D maps from 2D images without additional metadata, giving new potential to urban planning as well as entertainment experiences; we can perform pixel level separation of objects in images and video with applications ranging from public safety to medical robotics; and we can perform &amp;ldquo;super resolution&amp;rdquo; on photo images (upscale an image up to 10x) with a trained deep-learning system reconstructing, filling in, and thus sharpening images with information that would be omitted and lost using a standard digital zoom.</description>

Machine learning powers systems that can translate language, guide searches, and interact with humans. All around us we are seeing automated systems that are getting better and better at processing natural language. Machines that can work directly with natural language are powerful, especially as a human interface, because language is the most direct way in which we communicate.</description>

      <description>Active learning, which we explored in our report on Learning with Limited Labeled Data, makes it possible to build machine learning models with a small set of labeled data. The typical simplified workflow when tackling a supervised machine learning problem is to i) locate the data, ii) create labels for all available data (the more the merrier), and iii) build a model. Instead of labeling all available data, active learning takes advantage of collaboration between humans and machines to smartly pick a small subset of data to be labeled.</description>

      <description>Advancements in machine learning have evolved to such an extent that machines can not only understand the input data but have also learned to create it. Generative models are one of the most promising approaches towards this goal. To train such a model we first collect a large amount of data (be it images, text, etc.) and then train a model to generate data like it.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one such class of generative models, that, given a training dataset, learn to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set.</description>

      <description>Thanks to a mix of technology-driven disruption and savvy competitors, the business environment is an increasingly challenging one. Staying competitive requires a better understanding of customers’ behaviour and preferences. It also requires the ability to optimise internal processes to more efficiently support both these things. This is a big reason that so many organisations are investing in machine learning.
And yet the use of machine learning in organisations has not been universally welcomed by customers and service users.</description>

      <description>The goal in open-ended text generation is to create a coherent portion of text that is a continuation from the given context. For example, given a couple of sentences, this capability makes it possible for machines to self-write a coherent story. One can imagine using such a system for AI-assisted writing, but of course it can also be repurposed to generate misleading (fake) news articles.

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve written previously about the rapid growth and adoption of ML tools in the AutoML family. Specifically, we broke down AutoML into 4 categories:
 Citizen Data Science / ML Efficient Data Science / ML Learning to Learn Transfer Learning  Advancement has been especially rapid in tools designed to make Data Science/ML more efficient, and in learning to automate/optimize model architecture design. While these frameworks and tools have continued to mature, their prominence has unveiled another set of challenges.</description>

      <description>Active learning allows us to be smart about picking the right set of datapoints for which to create labels. Done properly, this approach results in models that are trained on less data performing comparatively to models trained on much more data. In the world of meta-learning, we do not focus on label acquisition; rather, we attempt to build a machine that learns quickly from a small number of training data.</description>

      <description>Machine learning used for facial recognition can have both potentially life-saving and privacy-killing consequences. The rise of cheap sensors, more robust data storage, and advances in machine learning have propelled many industries forward - for instance, many sensors used in the automative industry have focused on detecting vehicle malfunctions, maintenance needs, and even the early components of self-driving cars.

      <description>Active Learner shows how active learning selects which data to be labeled. Active Learner, our new research prototype, is an interactive visualization of different active learning strategies for labeling data. It features three different datasets (MNIST, Quickdraw, and Caltech) and four different data selection strategies (Random, Entropy, Adversarial, and Ensemble). By exploring the different datasets and strategies, you can build your intuition about how and why active learning works.

      <description>Many interesting learning problems exist in places where labeled data is limited. As such, much thought has been spent on how best to learn from limited labeled data. One obvious answer is simply to collect more data. That is valid, but for some applications, data is difficult or expensive to collect. If we will collect more data, we ought at least be smart about the data we collect. This motivates active learning, which provides strategies for learning in this scenario.</description>

      <description>The third annual TensorFlow Dev Summit was held. The entire first day of talks was live-streamed, and videos are available on the TensorFlow YouTube channel. I stayed up late (from the UK) watching a few of the talks, and here’s an entirely idiosyncratic description of three things I find exciting. A broader recap is provided by the TensorFlow team themselves.

      <description>In recent years, machine learning technologies - especially deep learning - have made breakthroughs which have turned science fiction into reality. Autonomous cars are almost possible, and machines can comprehend language. These technical advances are unprecedented, but they hinge on the availability of vast amounts of data.
For a form of machine learning known as supervised learning, having data itself is not sufficient. Supervised machine learning, while powerful, needs data in a form that can serve as examples for what machines should learn.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of work on our next report, Learning with Limited Labeled Data, and the accompanying prototype. For the prototype&amp;rsquo;s front-end we wanted to be able visualize and explore the embedding of a large image data set. Once you get into the tens of thousands of points, this can be a challenge to do in the browser. To determine whether what we wanted to do on the front-end was possible, I decided to make a demo focused on the MNIST hand-written digit data set.</description>

      <description>2018 was a fun and exciting year for natural language processing. A series of papers put forth powerful new ideas that improve the way machines understand and work with language. They challenge the standard way of using pretrained word embeddings like word2vec to initialize the first layer of a neural net, while the rest is trained on data of a particular task. Instead, these papers propose better embeddings (feature-based approach) and pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for a supervised downstream task (fine-tuning approach).</description>

      <description>As humans, we can quickly adapt our actions in new situations, be it recognizing objects from a few examples, or learning new skills and applying them in a matter of just a few minutes. But when it comes to deep learning techniques, an understandably large amount of time and data is required. So the challenge is to help our deep models do the same thing we can - to learn and quickly adapt from only a few examples, and to continue to adapt as more data becomes available.</description>

      <description>Machine learning on Spark: an abridged history Apache Spark - the cluster computing framework that&amp;rsquo;s been throwing shade at MapReduce since 2011 - has always been a bit remarkable, because it bridged the divide between data engineering and data science. One of the great promises of Spark was that it would be easy, trivial almost, to scale machine learning and data science to arbitrarily large data. Seven years later, Spark has made its place in data science, but perhaps not in the way we originally hoped.</description>

      <description>Machine learning (and more specifically, deep learning) techniques are recognized for their ability to obtain high accuracy for a variety of classification problems. Deep learning models are more complex than most traditional models and often have thousands of parameters and commensurately require more labeled training data. Obtaining this data can be an expensive and time-consuming process, and often requires domain experts to help with the labeling process. Many areas of machine learning that are motivated by this bottleneck could be broadly categorized into four areas: active learning, semi-supervised learning, weak supervision and transfer learning.</description>

      <description>Data science, machine learning (ML), and AI are no longer just cute buzzwords. Nearly all organizations, companies and governments now recognize the immense potential of AI-enabled products and services, and many of them have already made the very real investment of hiring employees with skills in these emerging fields.
However, as is true with most things in data science, one size does not fit all! Simply hiring a self-proclaimed data scientist or machine learning expert with advanced degrees isn&amp;rsquo;t likely to fit the bill.</description>

      <description>.post img { max-width: 460px } Deep learning has provided extraordinary advances in problem spaces that are poorly solved by other approaches. This success is due to several key departures from traditional machine learning that allow it to excel when applied to unstructured data. Today, deep learning models can play games, detect cancer, talk to humans, and drive cars.
But the differences that make deep learning powerful also make it costly.</description>

 Citizen Data Science / ML: Automated machine learning will allow everyone to do data science and ML. It requires no special training or skills. Efficient Data Science / ML: Automated machine learning will supercharge your data scientists and ML engineers by making them more efficient. Learning to Learn: Automated machine learning will automate architecture and optimization algorithm design(architecture search).</description>

      <description>From random forest to neural networks, many modern machine learning algorithms involve a number of parameters that have to be fixed before training the algorithm. These parameters, in contrast to the ones learned by the algorithm during training, are called hyperparameters. The performance of a model on a task given data depends on the specific values of these hyperparameters.
Hyperparamter tuning is the process of determining the hyperparameter values that maximize model performance on a task given data.</description>

      <description>One of the most exciting parts of our jobs at Cloudera Fast Forward Labs is our work on applied machine learning research. Through this research we see and work with some of the most exciting developments in machine learning, deep learning, and AI, but - as with any field that has been overhyped - we sift through a lot of noise. By noise, we generally mean research that is too immature to be of practical use, or research that follows one or more of the troubling trends in machine learning.</description>

      <description>Topic models can extract key themes from large collections of documents in an unsupervised manner, which makes them one of the most powerful tools in organizing, searching, and understanding the vast troves of text data produced by humanity. Their power derives, in part, from their in-built assumptions about the nature of text; specifically, to identify topics, the model has to give the notion of a topic a mathematical structure that echoes its significance to a human reader.</description>

Wax on.. face off! When humans learn new tasks, we take advantage of knowledge we&amp;rsquo;ve gained from learning, or having learned, related tasks. Take the 1984 movie Karate Kid, where Mr. Miyagi takes on Daniel as his martial arts student. He begins Daniel&amp;rsquo;s training by having him complete various lengthy menial chores, from waxing cars to sanding floors.</description>

      <description>Sequence labeling tasks attempt to assign a categorical label to each member in the sequence. In natural language processing, where a sequence generally refers to a sentence, examples of sequence labeling include named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging (POS) and error detection. NER, as the name implies, tries to recognize names in a sentence and classify them into pre-defined labels such as Person and Organization. POS tagging assigns labels such as noun, verb, and adjective to each word, while error detection identifies grammatical errors in sentences.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s machines can identify objects in photographs, predict loan repayments or defaults, write short summaries of long articles, or recommend movies you may like. Up until now, machines have achieved mastery through laser-like focus; most machine learning algorithms today train models to master one task, and one task only. We are excited to introduce multi-task learning in our upcoming webinar, report, and prototype. Multi-task learning is an approach to machine learning that goes beyond single-task approaches and supercharges classification by allowing algorithms to master more than one task at once and in parallel.</description>

      <description>While deep learning can be applied generally, much of the excitement around it has stemmed from significant breakthroughs in two main areas: computer vision and natural language processing. Practitioners have typically applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to spatial data (e.g. images) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to sequence data (e.g. text). However, a recent research paper has shown that convolutional neural networks are not only capable of performing well on sequential data tasks, but they have inherent advantages over recurrent networks and may be a better default starting point.</description>

      <description>Longtime readers of this newsletter know that we follow the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning conversation closely (see here and here). These conversations address and attempt to mitigate the potential for technical systems to produce unfairness. Much of this unfairness arises from how algorithmic systems might perpetuate historical inequalities or otherwise produce discriminatory effects. This conversation is broader than could be encapsulated in any newsletter, but we want to point to some recommendations that have come out of this conversation to demonstrate how we think through the challenges of building models that don&amp;rsquo;t learn or perpetuate bias.</description>

      <description>Are novel, complex, and specialized neural network architectures always better for language modeling? Recent papers have shown otherwise. Language models are used to predict the next token given the preceeding tokens. Most operate at word-level or character-level. Word-level models have large vocabulary sizes (how many words are there in the English language?) compared to character-level models (there are 26 letters in the English language). This means that character-level models require less memory.</description>

      <description>In the ongoing debates around whether or not robots are going to take our jobs, listening to those who have a real stake in the technology is critical, and often offers important insights for how we build new technologies, as well as how we talk about what we build. Take, for example, this blog post by Judy Gichoya about the Radiology Society of North America&amp;rsquo;s annual meeting last December, which provides a useful window into the concerns radiologists have about the ways automation will affect their profession, and how those concerns could be taken into account when building capabilities that impact their domain of expertise.</description>

      <description>The promise of Machine Learning (ML) on edge devices holds potential to enable new capabilities while reaping the benefits associated with on-device computation. As an environment that is frequently the source of data (user interactions, sensors such as cameras, acelerometers, etc.), the browser within PCs, mobile and IoT devices represents an important edge “platform.” Deploying models in such environments can improve latency for interactive applications, reduce model distribution costs, and enable privacy as data is no longer sent to remote servers for analysis.</description>

      <description>The common approach in machine learning is to train and optimize one task at a time. In contrast, multitask learning (MTL) trains related tasks in parallel, using a shared representation. One advantage of MTL is improved generalization - using information regarding related tasks prevents a model from being overly focused on a single task, while it is also learning to produce better results.
MTL is an approach, and is not restricted to any particular algorithm.</description>

      <description>In the spirit of Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, we at Fast Forward Labs thought it would be fun to bake cookies for our sweethearts. Being DIY nerds, we thought we&amp;rsquo;d math it up a bit.
We used python to generate probability distributions and matplotlib to check our distributions. Then we wrote a python function to generate a SCAD file defining three-dimensional shapes from the distributions. Using OpenSCAD, an open-source CAD program, we checked the 3D models and exported them to STL files for printing.</description>

      <description>Justin O&amp;rsquo;Beirne recently wrote a blog post surveying the landscape of mapping apps and sites (with particular focus on Google Maps and Apple Maps). This is one of a series of pieces O&amp;rsquo;Beirne has written comparing Google and Apple Maps. In short, O&amp;rsquo;Beirne concludes that Google has a substantial competitive advantage in mapping that boils down to having better data.

      <description>Cloud computing has transformed enterprise IT. It makes it possible to rapidly scale up and down a complex and global infrastructure, without the overhead of a datacenter. But living in the cloud can be expensive, and you still need to maintain computers and their operating systems, even if they are virtual. That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;ve been watching with interest the rise of &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; computing.
Serverless has the potential to open up &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; work to mere mortal data scientists who don&amp;rsquo;t have the budget or engineering support for a long-lived analytics cluster, and to make life simpler and reduce costs for those that do.</description>

      <description>While we commonly associate recommendation systems with e-commerce, their application extends to any decision-making problem which requires pairing two types of things together. To understand why recommenders don&amp;rsquo;t always work as well as we&amp;rsquo;d like them to, we set out to build some basic recommendation systems using publicly available data.
Data The first ingredient for building a recommendation system is user interaction data. We experimented with two different datasets, one from Flickr and one from Amazon.</description>

      <description>We end 2017 with a round-up of some of the research, talks, sci-fi, visualizations/art, and a grab bag of other stuff we found particularly interesting, enjoyable, or influential this year.
Stars from around the world. Image credit: Kyle McDonald Research 2017 saw renewed interest in using the human brain as an inspiration for machine learning &amp;mdash; perhaps most notably, Dynamic Routing Between Capsule Networks by Sabour, Frosst, and Hinton.
Somewhat to counter this trend (and Hinton&amp;rsquo;s criticism of stochastic gradient descent based on its biological implausibility) and to highlight necessary foundational work, we recommend two papers from Arpit, Jastrzębski, and collaborators: Memorization in Deep Neural Networks and The Factors Influencing Minima in SGD (with practical suggestions for developers) are beautiful examples of foundational work the field needs now that neural networks have proven to be effective applied problem solvers.</description>

      <description>Earlier this month The New York Times published an article on Building A.I. That Can Build A.I.. There is a lot of excitement about AutoML due to the scarcity of machine learning (ML) talent:
 By some estimates, only 10,000 people worldwide have the education, experience and talent needed to build the complex and sometimes mysterious mathematical algorithms that will drive this new breed of artificial intelligence.
 Furthermore, ML/AI experts are expensive: Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.</description>

      <description>In an almost Freudian twist, a play on Vatermord by an artificial intelligence, AlphaGo Zero has dethroned its &amp;ldquo;parent,&amp;rdquo; AlphaGo.
In March 2016, AlphaGo defeated 18-time world Go champion Lee Sedol. At the Future of Go Summit in May 2017, AlphaGo prevailed against China&amp;rsquo;s top Go players including Ke Jie, who was considered to be the world&amp;rsquo;s best Go player.
AlphaGo&amp;rsquo;s reign was short lived. On October 18th 2017, in a tournament to which human players were not invited, AlphaGo Zero beat AlphaGo.</description>

      <description>Pirating a copyrighted song, video, or e-book to listen to the song, watch the movie, or read the book is an infringement of copyright (which can be severely fined). So how about pirating a song, video, or e-book to train machine learning models?
NYU Teaching and Research Fellow Amanda Levendowski proposes a legal approach to reducing bias in machine learning models. Biased data leads to biased models, she argues, and use of existing public domain data, most of which is over 70 years old, introduces biases from a time before, e.</description>

      <description>Pioneers in artificial intelligence (AI) have worked across multiple related fields, including computer science, AI, neuroscience, and psychology - but as each of these areas of research have grown in complexity and disciplinary boundaries have solidified, collaboration has become less commonplace. In Neuroscience-Inspired Artificial Intelligence, the co-founder of Google DeepMind Demis Hassabis, alongside other renowned neuroscientists, argues to revive collaborative efforts.
The (human) brain is a living case-in-point that human-level general AI is possible, but building it is a daunting task.</description>

It contains all the stuff I learned while working on the project and is the place you should look for updated code. This post may still be interesting if you want to see my thoughts when I first started on the project. We&amp;rsquo;ve started work on our next prototype. While the design is still evolving, we&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure one element of it will be a visualization of tens of thousands of data points, clustered through a dimensional reduction algorithm (most likely using T-SNE).</description>

      <description>Earlier this year we launched a research report on probabilistic programming, an emerging programming paradigm that makes it easier to describe and train probabilistic models. The Bayesian probabilistic approach to model building and inference has many advantages in practical data science, including the ability to quantify risk (a superpower in industries like finance and insurance) and the ability to insert institutional knowledge (which is particularly useful when data is scarce). The rise of probabilistic programming languages has made it a more practical technique for time-constrained working data scientists.</description>

      <description>For some, Mayweather-McGregor was the prizefight of the summer. For others, it has been Musk-Zuckerberg going toe-to-toe over the risks posed by AI, with Musk voicing his reservations about artificial intelligence while Zuck remains more sanguine. Musk has called AI possibly the &amp;ldquo;biggest threat&amp;rdquo; to humanity and gone so far as to suggest the decidedly un-Catholic opinion that Silicon Valley should be welcoming regulatory oversight of AI in this one exceptional instance.</description>

      <description>Adversarial samples are inputs designed to fool a model: they are inputs created by applying perturbations to example inputs in the dataset such that the perturbed inputs result in the model outputting an incorrect answer with high confidence. Often, perturbations are so small that they are imperceptible to the human eye — they are inconspicuous.
Adversarial samples are a concern in a world where algorithms make decisions that affect lives: imagine an imperceptibly altered stop sign that the otherwise high-accuracy image recongnition algorithm of a self-driving car misclassifies as a toilet.</description>

      <description>Steganography is the​ practice​ of​ hiding messages​ anywhere​ they’re​ not expected‏‎. I⁠n a well-executed​ piece of​ steganography, anyone who​ is​ not the intended​ recipient can​ look at​ the​ message​ and not​ realize its there at all‏‎. In a recent headline-making story, The I⁠ntercept inadvertently outed​ their​ source​ by publishing​ a document with​ an embedded steganographic​ message that allowed​ the NSA to identify the​ person​ who printed it‏‎.
These days, information is​ often​ hidden​ in digital media​ like images and​ audio​ files, where flipping a few bits​ doesn’t change​ the​ file to​ the​ human​ eye (or ear)‏‎.</description>

      <description>Model-building has a venerable history that long predates parallel processing, python, and perceptrons. Physical, scale models and maps have helped humans think through complex processes and ambitious endeavors, from the rigging of a pharoah&amp;rsquo;s pleasure yacht to the Battle of Britain by reducing the complexity of the real world to the most important, salient features that affect a problem, and by bringing disconnected, distant phenomena into view from a single perspective.</description>

      <description>Twitter users can retweet, like or reply to a tweet. If a tweet from a prominent account gets more replies than retweets then that&amp;rsquo;s usually Not Good.
Take, for example, this recent tweet from United Airlines. It got three times more replies than retweets. Those replies are not filled with praise, and that ratio was a sign to United&amp;rsquo;s PR team that they were in trouble, in case it wasn&amp;rsquo;t already obvious.</description>

      <description>Working with over 30 enterprise clients, in industries like financial services, insurance, publishing, and retail, the Fast Forward Labs team has had ample opportunity to observe the challenges of doing data science in practice. By now, most organizations have moved beyond traditional waterfall software development process to adopt more risk-tolerant and agile methodologies. But directly applying agile to data science can create friction, as data products require more leeway for experimentation and exploration, as well as open communication between business, science, and engineering teams.</description>

      <description>This post originally appeared on quamproxime.com, the personal blog of our sales and marketing lead, Kathryn Hume One of the main arguments the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari makes in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is that mankind differs from other species because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers, united in cause and spirit not by anything real, but by the fictions of our collective imagination. Examples of these fictions include gods, nations, money, and human rights, which are supported by religions, political structures, trade networks, and legal institutions, respectively.</description>

      <description>Facebook recently released Prophet, a general purpose time series forecasting package with both Python and R interfaces.
Python and R already have plenty of time series forecasting options, so why is Prophet interesting? It caught our eye because the backend is implemented in Stan, a probabilistic programming language we researched in our most recent report.
This choice means that Prophet offers many of the advantages of the Bayesian approach. In particular, the models have a simple, interpretable structure (seasonality) on which prior analyst knowledge can be imposed, and forecasts include confidence intervals derived from the full posterior distribution, which means they offer a data-driven estimate of risk.</description>

      <description>Probabilistic Real Estate is a prototype we built to explore the New York City real estate market. As explained in a previous post, we used probabilistic programming&amp;rsquo;s ability to incorporate hierarchical models to make predictions across neighborhoods with sparse amounts of pricing data. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on how we designed the prototype to capitalize on another strength of probabilistic programming: the ability to generate probability distributions.
Prototype Overview: Price Mode In price mode, Probabilistic Real Estate shows the median price for each neighborhood.</description>

Our research team spent last week in London hosting sessions and workshops about applied machine learning at the QCon conference. Micha Gorelick gave a talk about building a working product with Keras, a high level deep learning framework. He started by explaining deep learning at a conceptual level (describing neural networks like universal approximation theorems to approximate arbitrary functions by iteratively tuning weights and biases on training data) and then showed the code and design decisions we used to train and deploy our model for automated text summarization.</description>

      <description>In a modern twist on Claude Shannon&amp;rsquo;s Theseus, SigOpt explains optimization by teaching a mouse to solve a randomly generated maze The learning of machine learning refers to the process of updating and tuning the parameters of a model. For example, if we take the function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, learning would mean to change the values of a, b, and c so that our function does a better job describing our data.</description>

      <description>Machine learning models are used for important decisions like determining who has access to bail. The aim is to increase efficiency and spot patterns in data that humans would otherwise miss. But how do we know if a machine learning model is fair? And what does fairness in machine learning mean?
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore these questions using FairML, a new Python library that audits black-box predictive models and is based on work I did with my advisor while at MIT.</description>

      <description>As mobile devices become central to our personal and professional lives, their security is more and more important. Passcodes in particular can be lost (or forcibly surrendered) to law enforcement. Recent research has focussed on behavioural authentication based on patterns of user interaction. This could provide an unintrusive authentication method that operates during normal use.

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re excited to release the latest research from our machine intelligence R&amp;amp;D team! This report and prototype explore probabilistic programming, an emerging programming paradigm that makes it easier to construct and fit Bayesian inference models in code. It&amp;rsquo;s advanced statistics, simplified for data scientists looking to build models fast.
Bayesian inference has been popular in scientific research for a long time. The statistical technique allows us to encode expert knowledge into a model by stating prior beliefs about what we think our data looks like.</description>

      <description>A rolling regression with PyMC3: instead of the regression coefficients being constant over time (the points are daily stock prices of 2 stocks), this model assumes they follow a random-walk and can thus slowly adapt them over time to fit the data best. Probabilistic programming is coming of age. While normal programming languages denote procedures, probabilistic programming languages denote models and perform inference on these models. Users write code to specify a model for their data, and the languages run sampling algorithms across probability distributions to output answers with confidence rates and levels of uncertainty across a full distribution.</description>

      <description>We at Fast Forward Labs have long been interested in speech recognition technologies. This year’s chatbot craze has seen growing interest in machines that interface with users in friendly, accessible language. Bots, however, only rarely understand the complexity of colloquial conversation: many practical customer service bots are trained on a very constrained set of queries (”I lost my password”). That’s why we’re excited to highlight Gridspace, a San Francisco-based startup that provides products, services, and an easy-to-use API focused on making human-to-human conversation analyzable by machines.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction and Intuition</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but to make its nature clearer to you, my happy readers, who are privileged to live in Space.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So reads the first sentence of Edwin Abbott Abbott’s 1884 work of science fiction and social satire, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201&#34;&gt;Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; At the time, Abbott used contemporary developments in the fields of geometry and topology (he was a contemporary of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9&#34;&gt;Poincaré&lt;/a&gt;) to illustrate the rigid social hierarchies in Victorian England. A century later, with machine learning algorithms playing an increasingly prominent role in our daily lives, Abbott’s play on the conceptual leaps required to cross dimensions is relevant again. This time, however, the dimensionality shifts lie not between two human social classes, but between the domains of human reasoning and intuition and machine reasoning and computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the recent excitement around artificial intelligence stems from the fact that computers are newly able to process data historically too complex to analyze. At Fast Forward Labs, we’ve been excited by new capabilities to use computers to &lt;a href=&#34;http://pictograph.us&#34;&gt;perceive objects in images&lt;/a&gt;, extract the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/brief/&#34;&gt;most important sentences from long bodies of text&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html&#34;&gt;translate between languages&lt;/a&gt;. But making complex data like images or text tractable for machines involves representing the data in high-dimensional vectors, long strings of numbers that encode the complexity of pixel clusters or relationships between words. The problem is these vectors become so large that it’s hard for humans to make sense of them: plotting them often requires a space of way more than the three dimensions we live in and perceive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, machine learning techniques that entirely remove humans from the loop, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.automl.org/&#34;&gt;automatic machine learning&lt;/a&gt; and unsupervised learning, are still active areas of research. For now, machines perform best when nudged by humans. And that means we need a way to reverse engineer the high-dimensionality vectors machines compute in back down to the two and three dimensional spaces our visual systems have evolved to make sense of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is a brief survey of some tools available to reduce and visualize high-dimensional data. Send us a note at contact@fastforwardlabs.com if you know of others!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Probabilistic data structures store data compactly with low memory and provide approximate answers to queries about stored data. They are designed to answer queries in a space-efficient manner, which can mean sacrificing accuracy. However, they typically provide guarantees and bounds on error rates depending on specifications of the data structure in question. Because they provide low memory footprints, probabilisitic data structures are particularly useful ink streaming and low power settings.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Google released new TensorFlow model code for text summarization, specifically for generating news headlines on the Annotated English Gigaword dataset. We’re excited to see others working on summarization, as we did in our last report: our ability to “digest large amounts of information in a compressed form” will only become more important as unstructured information grows. The TensorFlow release uses sequence-to-sequence learning to train models that write headlines for news articles.</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s no small feat to commercialize new technologies that arise from scientific and academic research. The useful is a small subset of the possible, and the features technology users (let alone corporate buyers) care about rarely align with the problems researchers want to solve. But it’s immensely exciting when it works. When the phase transition is complete. When the general public starts to appreciate how a bunch of mathematics can impact their business, their lives, and their understanding of how the world works. It’s why the Fast Forward Labs team wakes up every day. It’s why we love what we do. It drives us. And it’s why we’re always on the lookout for people who are doing it well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://orbitalinsight.com/&#34;&gt;Orbital Insight&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent example of a company that is successfully commercializing deep learning technologies. 2015 saw a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/science/an-advance-in-artificial-intelligence-rivals-human-vision-abilities.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;series of improvements&lt;/a&gt; in the performance of object recognition and computer vision systems. The technology is being applied across domains, to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.enlitic.com/&#34;&gt;improve medical diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, gain &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.clarifai.com/&#34;&gt;brand insights&lt;/a&gt;, or update our &lt;a href=&#34;http://pictograph.us&#34;&gt;social media experience&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on his experience at The Climate Corporation, Orbital Insight CEO  &amp;amp; Founder &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmcrawfordjr&#34;&gt;Jimi Crawford&lt;/a&gt; decided to aim big and apply the latest in computer vision to satellite imagery. His team focused their first commercial offering on the financial services industry, honing their tools to count cars in parking lots to infer company performance and, transitively, stock market behavior. But hedge funds are just the beginning. Crawford’s long-term ambition (as that of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.featurex.ai/&#34;&gt;FeatureX&lt;/a&gt;) is to reform macroeconomics, to replace government reports with quantified observations about the physical world. &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/27/orbital-insight-lands-20-million-from-investors-led-by-gv/&#34;&gt;Investors have taken notice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We interviewed Jimi, discussing what he learned in the past, what he does in the present, and what he envisions for the future. Read on for highlights. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Under the Hood of the Variational Autoencoder (in Prose and Code)</title>

In &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/08/12/introducing-variational-autoencoders-in-prose-and.html&#34;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; of this series, we introduced the theory and intuition behind the VAE, an exciting development in machine learning for combined generative modeling and inference—&lt;a href=&#34;http://shakirm.com/slides/DLSummerSchool_Aug2016_compress.pdf&#34;&gt;“machines that imagine and reason.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap: VAEs put a probabilistic spin on the basic autoencoder paradigm—treating their inputs, hidden representations, and reconstructed outputs as probabilistic random variables within a directed graphical model. With this &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1236/&#34;&gt;Bayesian&lt;/a&gt; perspective, the encoder becomes a variational &lt;em&gt;inference network&lt;/em&gt;, mapping observed inputs to (approximate) posterior distributions over latent space, and the decoder becomes a &lt;em&gt;generative network&lt;/em&gt;, capable of mapping arbitrary latent coordinates back to distributions over the original data space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/blog-images/miriam/imgs_code/vae.4.png&#34; title=&#34;A variational autoencoder&#34; style=&#34;width:80.0%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this setup is that we can take a principled Bayesian approach toward building systems with a rich internal “mental model” of the observed world, all by training a single, cleverly-designed deep neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These benefits derive from an enriched understanding of data as merely the tip of the iceberg—the observed result of an underlying causative probabilistic process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of the resulting model is captured by Feynman’s famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://archives-dc.library.caltech.edu/islandora/object/ct1:483&#34;&gt;chalkboard quote&lt;/a&gt;: “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” When trained on MNIST handwritten digits, our VAE model can parse the information spread thinly over the high-dimensional observed world of pixels, and condense the most meaningful features into a structured distribution over reduced latent dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having recovered the latent manifold and assigned it a coordinate system, it becomes trivial to walk from one point to another along the manifold, creatively generating realistic digits all the while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/blog-images/miriam/imgs_code/160816_1754_reloaded_latent_784_500_500_50_round_65536_morph_4730816952.gif&#34; title=&#34;Generatively morphing digits&#34;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll take a look under the hood at the math and technical details that allow us to optimize the VAE model we sketched in &lt;a href=&#34;http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/2016/08/12/introducing-variational-autoencoders-in-prose-and.html&#34;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we’ll show how to implement a VAE in &lt;a href=&#34;http://tensorflow.org/&#34;&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt;—a library for efficient numerical computation using data flow graphs, with key features like &lt;a href=&#34;http://alexey.radul.name/ideas/2013/introduction-to-automatic-differentiation/&#34;&gt;automatic differentiation&lt;/a&gt; and parallelizability (across clusters, CPUs, GPUs…and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html&#34;&gt;TPUs&lt;/a&gt; if you’re lucky). You can find (and tinker with!) the full implementation &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fastforwardlabs/vae-tf/tree/master&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, along with a couple &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fastforwardlabs/vae-tf/tree/master/out&#34;&gt;pre-trained models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Effective machine learning means building expressive models that sift out signal from noise—that simplify the complexity of real-world data, yet accurately intuit and capture its subtle underlying patterns.
Whatever the downstream application, a primary challenge often boils down to this: How do we represent, or even synthesize, complex data in the context of a tractable model?
This challenge is compounded when working in a limited data setting—especially when samples are in the form of richly-structured, high-dimensional observations like natural images, audio waveforms, or gene expression data.</description>

&lt;p&gt;What is music? Or rather, what differentiates music from noise?&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ask John Cage, “everything we do is music.” Forced to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTEFKFiXSx4&#34;&gt;sit silently for 4’33”&lt;/a&gt;, we masters of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia&#34;&gt;apophenia&lt;/a&gt; end up hearing music in noise (or just squirm in discomfort&amp;hellip;), perceiving order and meaning in sounds that normally escape notice. For Cage, music is in the ears of the listener. To study it is to study how we perceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cage wrote 4’33” at time when many artists were challenging inherited notions of art. Others, dating back to Pythagoras (who defined harmony in terms of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_hammers#cite_note-8&#34;&gt;ratios and proportions&lt;/a&gt;), have defined music through the structural properties that make music &lt;i&gt;music, &lt;/i&gt;and separate different musical styles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest efforts to understand music lie in the field of machine listening, where researchers use computers to analyze audio data to identify meaning and structure in it like humans do. Some machine listening researchers analyze urban and environmental sounds, as at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wp.nyu.edu/sonyc/&#34;&gt;SONYC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This August in NYC, researchers in machine listening and related fields will convene at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wp.nyu.edu/ismir2016/&#34;&gt;International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) conference&lt;/a&gt;. The conference is of interest to anyone working in data or digital media, offering practical workshops and hackathons for the NYC data community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We interviewed NYU Steinhardt Professor &lt;a href=&#34;http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl/people/bello&#34;&gt;Juan Pablo Bello&lt;/a&gt;, an organizer of ISMIR 2016 working in machine listening, to learn more about the conference and the latest developments in the field.

&lt;h5 id=&#34;ndash-matthew-2221&#34;&gt;– Matthew, 22:21&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think that recommender systems are old hat. ECommerce platforms like Amazon have been using techniques like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/How-does-Amazons-collaborative-filtering-recommendation-engine-work&#34;&gt;collaborative filtering&lt;/a&gt; for years to help shoppers navigate vast catalogues by inferring consumer taste from past behavior. And yet, we’ve all experienced the limitations of these approaches (that time you bought a toilet bowl plunger to subsequently be flooded by recommendations for strange bathroom accessories). This may be a nuisance for consumers, but it doesn’t jeopardize eCommerce business models: only 35% of Amazon’s sales, for example, are driven from recommendations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what would happen if the stakes were higher? What kind of algorithmic creativity would it take to build a company with revenue based entirely on recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the challenge faced by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ericcolson&#34;&gt;Eric Colson&lt;/a&gt;’s team at &lt;a href=&#34;http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/&#34;&gt;Stitch Fix&lt;/a&gt;. Stitch Fix is an online “personal styling service” that selects clothing apparel for customers (they also have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/&#34;&gt;solid technical blog&lt;/a&gt;). Instead of recommending items for shoppers to choose from, Stitch Fix goes a step further and simply ships items its algorithms and stylists choose to customers. The key to making this work, according to Colson, is to optimize the division of labor between human and machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colson &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rId42xabXY&#34;&gt;spoke about&lt;/a&gt; the value of human-machine collaborations at the March &lt;a href=&#34;http://datadrivennyc.com/&#34;&gt;Data Driven NYC Meetup&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>The Fast Forward Labs research team is developing our next prototype, which will demonstrate an application of probabilistic programming. Probabilistic programming languages are a set of high-level languages that lower the barrier to entry for Bayesian data analysis.
Bayesian data analysis is often seen as the best approach to machine learning. Models derived by this process are highly interpretable, in contrast to other modern models like neural networks and support vector machines.</description>

      <description>Since we released our text summarization resources, the legal technology community has shown interest in leveraging summarization technology to support litigation document review, deposition digests, and contract analysis. Data scientist interest to use machine learning to mine legal document corpuses and support legal strategy was also one factor motivating our summarization research. The time is therefore ripe for data scientists to apply new text analytics capabilities for legal use cases.</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-nist-text-retrieval-conference-trec-logo&#34;&gt;The NIST Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) Logo&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/04/11/new-tools-to-summarize-text.html&#34;&gt;recently released research&lt;/a&gt; on neural network methods to summarize text. Systems like &lt;a href=&#34;http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/brief/&#34;&gt;Brief&lt;/a&gt;, our summarization prototype, are poised to modify how we consume text. Content systems were historically designed to help humans find, read, and research documents. But as electronically stored information continues to proliferate, systems will inevitably evolve to support research conducted by a man-machine partnership: machines will take the first pass to synthesize vast amounts of information, and humans will step in to derive more nuanced conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One field where this man-machine partnership is increasingly important is electronic discovery (eDiscovery), the processes lawyers use to discover information relevant for litigation. The traditional model, where armies of associates and paralegals read documents to find relevant information, does not scale to contemporary information volumes. To promote efficiency and curb the exorbitant costs of review, judges have issued opinions permitting the use of software that automatically finds evidence (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insidecounsel.com/2012/04/30/da-silva-moore-sets-stage-for-predictive-codings-a&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Da Silva Moore&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Publicis Groupe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and sometimes even requiring it (&lt;a href=&#34;https://e-discoveryteam.com/2012/10/25/news-flash-surprise-ruling-by-delaware-judge-orders-both-sides-to-use-predictive-coding/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;EORHB Inc.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;HOA Holdings LLC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in practice has created a large market for “technology-assisted review” (TAR) or “predictive coding” software. The industry is quite large, and vendors use TAR to refer to products that use rules-based Boolean logic as well as more advanced machine learning techniques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two voices in the space remain clear and constant. Since they met at the 2009 &lt;a href=&#34;http://trec.nist.gov/&#34;&gt;Text Retrieval Conference&lt;/a&gt; (TREC), &lt;a href=&#34;http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/&#34;&gt;Gordon Cormack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wlrk.com/MRGrossman/&#34;&gt;Maura Grossman&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&#34;http://cormack.uwaterloo.ca/cormack/calstudy/&#34;&gt;published multiple papers&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating that continuous active learning (CAL) is the most accurate and effective technique to find “substantially all” relevant information in a document collection. As they write in their recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://us.practicallaw.com/w-001-8253&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Practical Law &lt;/i&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAL is a method for finding substantially all relevant information on a particular subject within a vast sea of electronically stored information (ESI). At the outset, CAL resembles a web search engine, presenting first the documents that are most likely to be of interest, followed by those that are somewhat less likely to be of interest. Unlike a typical search engine, however, CAL repeatedly refines its understanding about which of the remaining documents are most likely to be of interest, based on the user’s feedback regarding the documents already presented. CAL continues to present documents, learning from user feedback, until none of the documents presented are of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We met with Cormack and Grossman to learn more about why they believe CAL is the best approach for eDiscovery and how the landscape is evolving.

      <description>Analyzing unstructured text data such as news, emails, chats, narrative prose, legal documents, or transcribed speech is an extremely tough problem. Thanks to massive leaps in data engineering, we can just about store and retrieve this torrent of information. But we can&amp;rsquo;t yet conduct the kind of rich and fast analyses that we take for granted with structured, quantitative data.
Our newly released summarization report is a response to this problem in two senses.</description>

Making language computable has been a goal of computer science research for decades. Historically, it has been a challenge to merely collect and store data. But it’s now so cheap to store data that we often have the opposite problem: once we’ve data, how should we analyze it to find meaning and insights?</description>

In 2012, Harvard Business Review proclaimed that &amp;ldquo;data scientist&amp;rdquo; was the sexiest job of the 21st century. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty amazing, considering that the job title was less than five years old at the time.
The Rapid Rise of Data Science DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher, then at LinkedIn and Facebook, coined the term in 2008 to capture the intersection of analytics, engineering, and product skills that was becoming critical to their companies.</description>

Stay tuned for a series of resources on the topic, including an online talk May 24 where we’ll cover technical details and survey use cases for financial services, media, and professional services with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.agolo.com/&#34;&gt;Agolo&lt;/a&gt;. Sign up &lt;a href=&#34;https://textsummarizationwebinar.splashthat.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In writing our reports, we try not only to inform readers about the libraries, math, and techniques they can use to put a system into production today, but also the lessons they can learn from historical approaches to a given topic. Turning a retrospective eye towards past work can be particularly helpful when using an algorithm like a &lt;a href=&#34;http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/&#34;&gt;recurrent neural network&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because neural networks are notoriously hard to interpret: feature engineering is left to the algorithm, and involves a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2015/09/24/how-do-neural-networks-learn.html&#34;&gt;complex interplay&lt;/a&gt; between the weight of individual computing nodes and the connections that link them together. In the face of this complexity, it can be helpful to keep former, more simple techniques in mind as a heuristic guide - or model - to shape our intuition about how contemporary algorithms work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, we found that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Peter_Luhn&#34;&gt;H.P. Luhn&lt;/a&gt;’s 1958 paper &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i256/f06/papers/luhn58.pdf&#34;&gt;The Automatic Creation of Literary Abstracts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;provided a simple heuristic to help wrap our heads around the basic steps that go into probabilistic models for summarizing text. (For those interested in history, Luhn also wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://altaplana.com/ibmrd0204H.pdf&#34;&gt;a paper about business intelligence&lt;/a&gt; in 1958 that feels like it could have been written today, as it highlights the growing need to automate information retrieval to manage an unwieldy amount of information.) Our design lead, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GrantCuster&#34;&gt;Grant Custer&lt;/a&gt;, designed a prototype you can play with to walk through Luhn’s method. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/luhn/&#34;&gt;Here’s the link&lt;/a&gt; to access the live demo. Feel free to use the suggested text, or to play around your own (and share results on Twitter!). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This article is available as a notebook on Github. Please refer to that notebook for a more detailed discussion and code fixes and updates. Despite all the recent excitement around deep learning, neural networks have a reputation among non-specialists as complicated to build and difficult to interpret.
And while interpretability remains an issue, there are now high-level neural network libraries that enable developers to quickly build neural network models without worrying about the numerical details of floating point operations and linear algebra.</description>

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, &lt;a href=&#34;http://siliconangle.tv/&#34;&gt;theCUBE&lt;/a&gt; stopped by the Fast Forward Labs offices to &lt;a href=&#34;http://siliconangle.tv/innovation-day-fast-forward-labs/&#34;&gt;interview us &lt;/a&gt;about our approach to innovation. In the interview, we highlighted that &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/02/16/machines-and-metaphors.html&#34;&gt;artists have an important role to play&lt;/a&gt; in shaping the future of machine intelligence. Unconstrained by market demands and product management requirements, artists are free to probe the potential of new technologies. And by optimizing for intuitive power or emotional resonance over theoretical accuracy or usability, they open channels to understand how machine intelligence is always, at its essence, a study of our own humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One provocative artist exploring the creative potential of new machine learning tools is &lt;a href=&#34;http://kylemcdonald.net/&#34;&gt;Kyle McDonald&lt;/a&gt;. McDonald has seized the deep learning moment, undertaking projects that use neural networks to document a stroll down the Amsterdam canals, &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kcimc/comparing-artificial-artists-7d889428fce4#.ltnl33b5p&#34;&gt;recreate images&lt;/a&gt; in the style of famous painters, or challenge our awareness of what we hold to be reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We interviewed Kyle to understand how he understands his work.

&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in deep learning research have renewed popular interest in machine intelligence. With new benchmarks set in tough problems (e.g., image classification and speech recognition), researchers are exploring unexpected and exciting applications, and eliciting public engagement and private investment. These recent breakthroughs have captured the attention of many for whom AI was previously obscure, as new capabilities spur applications of interest to wider public audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these advances have captured more than just our attention; they&amp;rsquo;ve captured our  imagination. Artists have been quick to apply these new techniques for novel creations, exploring the uncharted territories of machine creativity, slyly provoking questions of greater importance. What is creativity anyway? How do machines perceive, learn, and imitate?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Personalizing experiences and recommendations for consumers is the goal of many data science efforts, so much so that the NYC Media Lab created &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nycmedialab.org/personalizationpalooza-16/&#34;&gt;Personalizationpalooza&lt;/a&gt; to unite technicians and media leadership around the topic. And while &lt;a href=&#34;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1321962&#34;&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that recommendation algorithms promote happy consumers, it’s questionable that also they promote healthy citizens.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://technosociology.org/&#34;&gt;Zeynep Tufecki&lt;/a&gt;, for example, recently wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/message/how-facebook-s-tyranny-of-the-like-and-engagement-can-be-an-obstacle-to-an-open-and-connected-dddc03a0d39b#.2tc1yluvx&#34;&gt;Medium post &lt;/a&gt;explaining how Facebook’s focus on “engagement” as a metric for deciding which content to share on user news feeds can happen “to the detriment of the substantive experiences and interactions” she (and others) wants on Facebook. Zufecki illustrates her point with an instance where users felt morally unable to “like” a video with child refugees surrounded by dead bodies. She argues that the platform needs different mechanisms and metrics to ensure that content worth viewing can compete with the content we’re more apt to “like.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tufecki is not alone in her concerns. In 2011, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Pariser&#34;&gt;Eli Pariser&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.upworthy.com/&#34;&gt;Upworthy&lt;/a&gt;, wrote the first monograph about the risks algorithmic filtering poses to citizenship and society. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Filter-Bubble-Personalized-Changing/dp/0143121235&#34;&gt;The Filter Bubble&lt;/a&gt; is still worth reading today, as it provides a framework for understanding how filtering algorithms work and what personal, social, and political consequences they may have. It’s critical we understand these tools now that the 2016 election season is in full swing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recently interviewed Pariser to see how his thinking has evolved in light of recent algorithmic progress.

Featuring a series of ironic headlines (one simply says “Rip-off”) etched over beautiful images, the campaign emphasizes the company’s identity as a “challenger brand,” whose success “has been driven by marrying insights from data science with the emotional nature of fashion.” (CEO Chris Morton) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lyst.com&#34;&gt;Lyst&lt;/a&gt; provides fashion consumers with a central platform where they can mix and match millions of products from 11,500 different brands. In this context, data science serves as a virtual personal shopper, recommending products to users based upon insights from their behavior using the site. One might think these recommendations are powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering&#34;&gt;collaborative filtering&lt;/a&gt;, but the world of fashion is far too transient and fickle to support data models matching similar users. Matrices are sparse and inventory drains rapidly (consider flash sales sites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gilt.com/&#34;&gt;Gilt&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, recommendation algorithms align consumer behavior with product features. And as the world of fashion is one dominated by image and appearance, fashion data science has a lot to do with image analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We interviewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ejlbell&#34;&gt;Eddie Bell&lt;/a&gt;, Lyst’s lead data scientist, about his team’s current efforts to use deep learning to analyze images and personalize recommendations to consumers. We talked about his past, his team’s present, and the fashion industry’s future. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Possibly true statement: the Fast Forward Labs dog is the cutest dog in the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-orig-width=&#34;399&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;288&#34; class=&#34;tmblr-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://68.media.tumblr.com/7df25fbff433a17f0a2d414666eff600/tumblr_inline_nxxgbxBEMd1ta78fg_540.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-orig-width=&#34;399&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;288&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our General Counsel Ryan picked up the puppy a month ago and we’ve yet to name him. Ryan likes Renfield, which, as Bram Stoker fans know, evokes slightly different thoughts than “super cute,” particularly when &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaVZmo8CsGQ&#34;&gt;played by&lt;/a&gt; the ever-guttural Tom Waits. But the fact that we’re in no rush to name him tells us something about how we label and identify things. We know he’s a dog, we love him for his dogness, and thus far that’s been just fine. I personally tend to forget what breed he is, as my knowledge of dog breeds is shamefully sparse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pictograph, in contrast, does an excellent job recognizing that our puppy is in fact a blenheim spaniel. Pictograph is the public app we built to illustrate how neural nets identify objects in images. &lt;a href=&#34;http://pictograph.us&#34;&gt;Try it&lt;/a&gt; on your personal Instagram feed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-orig-width=&#34;658&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;216&#34; class=&#34;tmblr-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://68.media.tumblr.com/36ad21fb7fbc61e892ca66af5f684fe4/tumblr_inline_nxxgkiSgKa1ta78fg_540.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-orig-width=&#34;658&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;216&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 97% confidence rate in the accuracy of the prediction is a dream for automated classification. Here, the confidence is so high for two reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.image-net.org/&#34;&gt;ImageNet &lt;/a&gt;database used to train the Pictograph neural network has a lot of pictures of blenheim spaniels (971&amp;hellip;and yep, it’s prime). This labelled data informs the network what a correct classification &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; look like. The learning mechanism (called &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2015/09/24/how-do-neural-networks-learn.html&#34;&gt;backpropagation&lt;/a&gt;) then steps in and learns the network to predict the label “blenheim spaniel” when presented with new images that have similar features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the images in Ryan’s Instagram feed aren’t noisy. Note how the two images with 97% confidence rates show our puppy alone and facing the camera. This pose is similar to the stock images available on ImageNet, rendering it easier for the neural net to detect similarities. The confidence rate in the right-hand image including the human face drops to 62% because the data is noisier. It would likely drop further when presented an image of our puppy unconsciously playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros&#34;&gt;Ouroboros&lt;/a&gt; (the mythical snake that eats its own tail).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-orig-width=&#34;462&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;328&#34; class=&#34;tmblr-full&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://68.media.tumblr.com/bac3509687c5af7c21fd2fc853bf0501/tumblr_inline_nxxhlkZ4zi1ta78fg_540.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; data-orig-width=&#34;462&#34; data-orig-height=&#34;328&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Instagram, like most data in the wild, rarely contains clean data that maps neatly to a model’s parameters or the stock photos in a training set like ImageNet. In turn, classification systems can yield confidence rates as low as 20% or 30% (or lower), generating doubts as to whether it’s worth using the technology at all. One way to improve unsatisfying results from a machine learning tool is to adopt a “&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/the-wtf-economy/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-work-a0eaabea7c41&#34;&gt;human in the loop&lt;/a&gt;” approach, where humans step in and manually label images technology misclassifies or classifies with low confidence rates. But we decided to adopt a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They power Amazon’s product recommendations. They classify documents relevant for a lawsuit. They enable computers to play chess like the masters.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As machine learning applications expand to influence our civic, professional and private lives, it’s important that we all have a basic understanding of how they work and what potential they offer. &lt;a href=&#34;https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/&#34;&gt;Pedro Domingos&lt;/a&gt; undertook the challenge of providing the first comprehensive, nontechnical overview of machine learning in his new book, &lt;i&gt;The Master Algorithm&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Master Algorithm, &lt;/i&gt;Domingos divides the field into five different “tribes” &amp;ndash; symbolism, connectionism (neural networks), evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian networks, and analogical reasoning &amp;ndash; which he challenges his readers to unify in one future “master algorithm” capable of learning nearly anything. This will towards universality informs his book’s bold central hypothesis: “all knowledge - past, present, and future - can be derived from data by a single, universal learning algorithm.” It’s up to us to find it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had the pleasure of interviewing Domingos last week.

      <description>Deep learning is a hot and fascinating research area, particularly when applied to classifying images. While researching the Fast Forward Labs Deep Learning: Image Analysis report, we played with a lot of very cool technology. In this blog post, we offer a guide to getting started with deep learning by using APIs from some of the most interesting deep-learning-as-a-service startups.
These APIs accept images and/or video, and quickly classify objects, ideas, and items shown in the images and video.</description>

This morning, I spoke about opportunities for large, established companies to use data at a Corporate Longevity Leadership Briefing, hosted by the Financial Times. Here are two key takeaways from the panels: Memes generate excitement; excitement generates hype; hype generates confusion. In her panel, Hilary aimed to demystify some of the sorcery surrounding ‘big data’ that risks rendering data projects intimidating to mid-sized companies with limited resources.</description>

Many companies are working to retro-fit physical stores with capabilities originally developed for ecommerce. Without adding any new sensors or tags, image recognition company &lt;a href=&#34;https://blippar.com/en/&#34;&gt;Blippar &lt;/a&gt;provides APIs that digitize physical products to create an in-app experience around them. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/bof-exclusive/farfetch-e-commerce-fashion-brands-omnichannel&#34;&gt;Farfetch&lt;/a&gt;, which initially brought an exclusive network of luxury brick &amp;amp; mortar shops online, recently announced that it will soon provide in-store analytics.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, digital companies continue to seek out physical spaces to augment their customer experience. Warby Parker and Rent the Runway have physical stores, and Gilt and Etsy are exploring new models to engage consumers offline (Gilt has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://fashionista.com/2015/08/gilt-by-appointment&#34;&gt;private retail space&lt;/a&gt; in their corporate headquarters and Etsy &lt;a href=&#34;http://venturebeat.com/2015/08/25/etsy-squeezes-into-brick-and-mortar-stores-with-latest-shop-local-feature/&#34;&gt;launched an app&lt;/a&gt; to inform shoppers of sellers’ nearby products). These digital companies were built upon testing &lt;a href=&#34;http://pathtoperf.com/2015/04/07/01-with-lara-hogan.html&#34;&gt;every detail&lt;/a&gt; affecting their website performance. As tracking migrates to physical retail, it’s important that retailers consider the consumer experience risks associated with new technologies as they explore the benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you look at something on the web, you get ads that pop up and follow you around - companies like that have much better advantage over brick-and-mortar retailers, and so they&amp;rsquo;re under more pressure to equalise the playing field.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/oct/03/analytics-amazon-retailers-physical-cookies-high-street&#34;&gt;Kevin Kearns&lt;/a&gt;, ShopperTrak&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Neural networks are generating a lot of excitement, as they are quickly proving to be a promising and practical form of machine intelligence. At Fast Forward Labs, we just finished a project researching and building systems that use neural networks for image analysis, as shown in our toy applicationPictograph. Our companion deep learning report explains this technology in depth and explores applications and opportunities across industries.
As we built Pictograph, we came to appreciate just how challenging it is to understand how neural networks work.</description>

1) The success of a deep learning project depends on the quality of the initial training data set. Deep learning algorithms start by scanning massive data sets to identify features (inputs) that can be correlated with categories (outputs) to make sense of the data.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered what your photos say about how you look at the world and who you are? Your images won’t say much about what types of things you tend to post unless you routinely tag them. Our new toy application, Pictograph, catalogs the objects that make up your Instagram identity. Pictograph analyzes your Instagram photos and creates a visualization, or pictograph, of what you like to photograph. It’s a fun way to play with new deep learning algorithms for image analysis, and it makes some pretty hilarious mistakes.</description>

Sign up &lt;a href=&#34;https://deeplearningwebinar.splashthat.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a philosophical prelude to the upcoming report, we wanted to invite you to think about the emergent properties of neural nets. Let’s explore what 18th-century philosopher Denis Diderot can teach us about artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diderot was not your average Enlightenment philosopher. A &lt;i&gt;philosophe, &lt;/i&gt;he grappled with the colossal inheritance of mechanical philosophy that dominated 18th-century intellectual circles. Spearheaded by Descartes and Newton, the mechanical view held that the material world was composed of complicated machines governed and determined by immutable laws. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Part two will focus on implications for consumer privacy.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next frontier for recommender systems is the retail store. We’re used to associating machine learning with ecommerce giants like Gilt and Lyst, but can data science transform physical stores like Rebecca Minkoff and Zara? The impact would be significant, as more than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/digital-influences-in-retail-store-sales.html&#34;&gt;90% of retail sales still occur in brick-and-mortar stores&lt;/a&gt;, which could use data to redefine in-store personalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of data collection in the retail space does not always require new tools; rather, retailers can gather granular data on customers and products by repurposing existing hardware like security cameras and clothing sensors in new ways. Developments in machine learning have made it possible to auto-process existing video feeds to track customers, from simple movement analytics to full body profiles. Smart mirrors, security cameras (CCTV) and radio-frequency identification (RFID) sensors which create rich datasets that make automated personalization in bricks &amp;amp; mortar scalable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We like to hold fast to the myth of the individual creative genius as the source of the world’s most impactful scientific revolutions or disruptive innovations. But it’s consoling to recall how Isaac Newton consoled his rival Robert Hooke: “If I’ve seen further than others, it was by standing on the shoulders of giants.”
 This is French how painter Nicolas Poussin represents Cedalion providing sight to the blind Orion, a mythological pair associated with each generation’s progress over its predecessors.</description>

      <description>Today’s post is inspired by a slow-motion recording we captured of a Stirling engine that Ryan, Fast Forward’s General Counsel, just so happened to have lying around our New York City offices. For the non-mechanics among us, a Stirling engine is a heat engine that operates by cyclic compression and expansion of air and other gas at different temperatures; the temperature differential translates heat into mechanical work. The slowmo in the video renders a hypnotic locomotive sound that differs greatly from the mechanic buzz of realtime.</description>

      <description>On March 25, 1909, Wilbur Wright (of the Wright brothers) told a reporter at the Cairo, Illinois bulletin that “no airship will ever fly from New York to Paris.” As with most quotes inherited from the past, people often misinterpret Wright’s quote as reactionary because they read it out of context. He continues: “What limits the flight is the motor. No known motor can run at the requisite speed for four days without stopping, and you can’t be sure of finding the proper winds for soaring&amp;hellip;But the history of civilization has usually shown that every new invention has brought in its train new needs it can satisfy, and so what the airship will eventually be used for is probably what we can least predict at the present.</description>

      <description>Last Friday, Hilary joined Ira Flatow on Science Friday in the studio to discuss the question:Will Our Smartphones Know Us Better Than Ourselves?
We love imagining what our future may look like with the technology we are building.</description>

      <description>We take coffee pretty seriously here at Fast Forward Labs. In addition to our machine learning research, we have also explored both hot and cold coffee brewing technologies.
Research reveals that no one wants to drink a mug of hot brew once it settles to room temperature. As a slow sipper, I end up pouring out most of the coffee in my mug because it cools off too quickly. I set up this solution in a few minutes this afternoon using an off-the-shelf immersion heater and a microcontroller temperature regulator.</description>

      <description>We launched a redesign of the Fast Forward Labs website today. There are lots of parts of the design I’d like to write someday about but for this post I want to focus on the thinking behind the “Tech Graph” force-directed graph display in the Intro section.
Dramatizing Information Work The response I want the intro section to provoke is something like: “Wow, there is some really interesting work being done here that I would like to be involved with it.</description>

      <description>DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! NO PYTHONS WERE HURT IN THE CREATION OF THIS BLOG POST!
Check out the code at code at github.com/mynameisfiber/pytailcall
As an exercise into learning more about python 2.7 bytecode, I wanted to implement the thing that pythonistas love to hate - tail call optimization! This isn&amp;rsquo;t novel at all, but I chose to implement this only using the standard library so that I could understand more about generating and modifying bytecode.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s restyled blog day here at Fast Forward Labs! Having wrapped up our second report, I (Grant, Fast Forward Labs designer-dev) am now spending some time putting our web presence in order. The real big piece of that is a revamped Fast Forward website, which should be out next week, but as a warm-up today I worked on getting our blog into shape.
I wanted to keep things clean and simple (to go with the grain).</description>

      <description>Our second R&amp;amp;D Report, Probabilistic Methods for Realtime Streams, has gone out! In this report, we explored probabilistic algorithms for machine learning on potentially large realtime streams of data with efficient CPU and memory usage.
Our prototype demonstrated these algorithms running on large amounts of social conversation data. More on that soon.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re very pleased to announce our second research report topic will be realtime stream analysis, with a focus on probabilistic data structures. Using these techniques, we&amp;rsquo;re able to build systems that enable extremely fast and memory efficient computation over very large data sets. For example, imagine being able to do comparisons between two sets of billions of items in milliseconds using only a few megabytes of memory.
We&amp;rsquo;re exploring applications with partners in marketing, healthcare, and science.</description>

      <title>We Built a Table</title>

      <description>At Fast Forward Labs we’re thoughtful about the kind of work space we want to spend our time in. We decided that we preferred a shared large table instead of individual desks, to make it easier to collaborate and offer the flexibility to spread out when necessary, and to allow space for other people to drop in and work with us.
We also love to build things, and find an hour of working with our hands to be a welcome respite from hours of math, programming, reading, and writing, so we decided to build it ourselves!</description>

      <description>I’m very pleased to introduce Fast Forward Labs.
Fast Forward Labs is an independent data technology research lab. We focus on taking technologies that are just becoming possible, and making them useful.
We believe that the existing research structures are failing in 2014. We offer companies a new approach to applied research that helps them find those product and business opportunities that exist at the intersection of their existing business and new data and technology capabilities.</description>
