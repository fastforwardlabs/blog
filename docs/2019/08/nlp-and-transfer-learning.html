    <h1>NLP and Transfer Learning</h1>
    <h2 id="nlp-and-transfer-learning">NLP and Transfer Learning</h2>
<p>Natural language processing just took a leap forward with the release of new high-quality language models combined with transfer learning. As you know, at Cloudera Fast Forward Labs, we have been researching this leap forward and have just finished a <a href="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2019/07/17/new-research-transfer-learning-for-natural-language-processing.html">new report on the topic</a>.</p>
<p>These new NLP models rely on deep neural networks, which are data hungry and compute intensive to train. Various research groups trained these new models with tremendous amounts of data and compute power. They are also aware of the sequential nature of language, i.e., the flow of words and sentences, and the context in which words appear. These models have a much more nuanced understanding of language than prior approches, and they&rsquo;re now available for anyone to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/google-research/bert">BERT (Google)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/tutorials/how_to/elmo.md">ELMo (AllenNLP / UW Computer Science and Engineering)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nlp.fast.ai/">ULMFiT (available through fast.ai libraries)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2 (OpenAI)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These models are very powerful, but they are limited, at least facially, to the task for which they were trained. Specifically, they are trained to generate language, i.e., predict the next words following an input prompt. Training a model for this task is straightforward because any text is self-labeling - that is: any text can be used as input data because the next word is always known, so the model can guess the next word and then check the next word to see whether it was correct.</p>
<p>Training models for other tasks requires data that is harder to obtain. For example, sentiment analysis - the task of predicting how an author feels based on their writing - would require writing samples labeled with the author&rsquo;s actual opinion. Labeling this data requires a human to read the text and make their own assessment of the author&rsquo;s feeling about the subject (positive, negative, or neutral). This training data is very expensive to create.</p>
<p>The technique of transfer learning adapts recently-released pre-trained language models for other tasks. Transfer learning uses the pre-trained models&rsquo; extensive understanding of language and applies it to new tasks with relatively little training data. So a pre-trained model can be adapted to the task of sentiment analysis with very little labeled sentiment data.</p>
<p>The chart below shows the accuracy of several models predicting sentiment as a function of how many labeled training examples each model was shown. For example, a naive Bayes support vector machine and a word vector model (both older technologies) scored around 50% accuracy &ndash; about the same as guessing &ndash; when shown 100 training examples. Two of the newer pre-trained models, BERT and ULMFiT, adapted for sentiment analysis, are 85% accurate with the same 100 training examples.</p>
<p><img src="/images/editor_uploads/2019-08-08-164145-NLP_Comparison.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Not only do the pre-trained models work with fewer labeled examples, they also work better than the older technologies at any number of labeled examples.</p>
<p>These models permit higher performance with less data, and they are easier to use than traditional deep learning models, so they don&rsquo;t require a data scientist with NLP specialization. They can also be adapted to any natural language task. Here are some examples of these tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer service - routing customer phone calls or emails based on what the customer says they want</li>
<li>Marketing - understanding public opinions about a new product or service</li>
<li>Document management - understanding what information a document contains</li>
<li>Search - looking for answers to questions within text data</li>
</ul>
<p>So with pre-trained models and transfer learning, many NLP tasks are now accessible without a great deal of labeled data, without an NLP PhD on staff, and without special computer hardware.  This opens up dozens of possibilities.</p>

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

    Introduction This is the first part of a series to review Bias in Knowledge Graphs (KG). We aim to describe methods of identifying bias, measuring its impact, and mitigating that impact. For this part, we’ll give a broad overview of this topic.

    Why do privacy and governance matter? Data privacy has been a common conversation topic among the general public since the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. The data &ldquo;breach,&rdquo; in which user information was hoovered up through a Facebook quiz and subsequently misrepresented as being used for academic purposes, resulted in over $5 billion in fines for Facebook. However, Facebook&rsquo;s infringements were, in fact, relatively narrow in scope (though nonetheless egregious) compared to the growing remit of privacy law.

    Our anomaly detection prototype, Blip, shows how four different algorithms perform at detecting network attacks. Here is a look at some of the design, visualization, and front-end programming decisions that went into it. (For more on the algorithms themselves, check out the prototype section of our report.)
Tomato sorting The concept of an anomaly is easy to visualize: it&rsquo;s something that doesn&rsquo;t look the same. The conceptual simplicity of it actually makes our prototype&rsquo;s job trickier.

 In recent years, we have seen an unprecedented increase in the availability of data in a variety of domains: manufacturing, health care, finance, IT, and others. Applications leverage this data to make informed decisions. This comes with its own set of challenges (and opportunities) when things start to fail; for instance, what happens when a piece of equipment fails or a network suffers from a security vulnerability?

    For the past decade, humans have unknowingly come to depend on Knowledge Graphs on a daily basis. From personalized shopping recommendations to intelligent assistants and user-friendly search results, many of these accepted (and expected) features have come to fruition through the exploitation of knowledge graphs. Despite their longstanding conceptual and practical existence, knowledge graphs were just added to the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies in 2018 and have continued to garner attention as an area of active research and development for their distinct ability to represent real-world relationships.

  <div class="small">Interpretability, or the ability to explain why and how a system makes a decision, can help us improve models, satisfy regulations, and build better products. Black-box techniques like deep learning have delivered breakthrough capabilities at the cost of interpretability. In this report, recently updated to include techniques like SHAP, we show how to make models interpretable without sacrificing their capabilities or accuracy.</div>

  <div class="small">From fraud detection to flagging abnormalities in imaging data, there are countless applications for automatic identification of abnormal data. This process can be challenging, especially when working with large, complex data. This report explores deep learning approaches (sequence models, VAEs, GANs) for anomaly detection, when to use them, performance benchmarks, and product possibilities.</div>
