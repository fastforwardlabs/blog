<p>When an algorithm is taught to paint the Mona Lisa in the style of van Gogh’s Starry Night, it doesn&rsquo;t just demonstrate an ability to paint like van Gogh; it demonstrates a much more general ability to emulate human behavior. Taken further, it shows the capacity of an algorithm to take bits of seemingly disorganized and meaningless morsels of data&ndash;pixels, characters&ndash;and abstract knowledge from them which is quite meaningful to humans. Even the world&rsquo;s foremost researchers are admittedly awestruck by these results. We may understand the math, but the intuition for <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2015/09/02/dalemberts-deep-dream-bees-and-nonlinear.html">why it works escapes us</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width="558" data-orig-height="276" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/3cbe548003e0178e5a8bc834ca134f6b/tumblr_inline_o2nesdb9uq1ta78fg_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="558" data-orig-height="276"/></figure>

<p>Artistic applications can help mitigate this uncertainty, and naturally, many are initiated within the research community itself, sometimes with intentionally creative undertones. <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.in/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html">Deepdream</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576">style transfer</a> (or &ldquo;neural style&rdquo;, &ldquo;#<a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=images&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23stylenet">stylenet</a>&rdquo;) were publicly released by researchers, piquing the curiosity of many practitioners online (including <a href="http://genekogan.com/works/style-transfer.html">myself</a>) who riffed on the software to create countless artworks. Both received a great deal of mainstream press coverage [<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-07/03/google-deep-dream">1</a>][<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/11730050/deep-dream-best-images.html">2</a>][<a href="http://www.popsci.com/turn-your-life-computers-dream-world">3</a>][<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/02/computer-algorithm-recreates-van-gogh-painting-picasso">4</a>][<a href="http://qz.com/495614/computers-can-now-paint-like-van-gogh-and-picasso/">5</a>][<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3214634/The-algorithm-learn-copy-artist-Neural-network-recreate-snaps-style-Van-Gogh-Picasso.html">6</a>], becoming among the first examples of machine-learned generative art being shown to wider audiences. Using <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/">Justin Johnson</a>&rsquo;s popular <a href="https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style">neural-style</a> implementation, I produced a <a href="http://vimeo.com/139123754">restyled version</a> of a scene from Alice in Wonderland. At the time, the results seemed too good to be real, but I had a hunch that more clarity would arrive downstream.<br/></p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code">implementation</a> of a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434">deep convolutional generative adversarial network</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434">(</a>D<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434">C</a>G<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434">A</a>N<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434">)</a> published on Github by <a href="https://twitter.com/alecrad">Alec Radford</a>, <a href="http://soumith.ch">Soumith Chintala</a>, and <a href="http://lukemetz.github.io/">Luke Metz</a> is a good example of research partially motivated by creative goals. Describing their algorithm as &ldquo;tripping&rdquo; and packing the <a href="https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code/blob/master/README.md">README</a> with troves of machine-hallucinated psychedelia, they seemed to be deliberately inviting artists to repurpose their code. So I took the bait and trained a DCGAN to generate <a href="http://www.genekogan.com/works/a-book-from-the-sky.html">animated interpolations of handwritten Chinese characters</a>. Others applied the technique to produce <a href="https://twitter.com/vintermann/status/675599478494208000">fake flowers</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mattya/chainer-DCGAN/blob/master/README.md">manga characters</a>, eliciting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10153269667222143">praise from Yann LeCun</a> and others.</p><figure data-orig-width="512" data-orig-height="314" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/450487b441fdae6b17b5fe7a75e562e9/tumblr_inline_o2nf2jx1V41ta78fg_540.gif" alt="image" data-orig-width="512" data-orig-height="314"/></figure>

<p>Spurred by these and others, more creative machine learning hacks have appeared in recent months, including another project involving Chinese characters by <a href="https://twitter.com/hardmaru">@hardmaru</a>. Here, the artist <a href="http://blog.otoro.net/2015/12/28/recurrent-net-dreams-up-fake-chinese-characters-in-vector-format-with-tensorflow/">invented wholly new characters</a> from a trained <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">recurrent neural network</a>. Continuing with the theme of written language aesthetics, <a href="http://erikbern.com">Erik Bernhardsson</a> explored the <a href="http://erikbern.com/2016/01/21/analyzing-50k-fonts-using-deep-neural-networks/">latent space of typography</a>, training a network on 50,000 fonts. Another strain of research, combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks, has produced software capable of annotating or describing images with natural language [<a href="https://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller">1</a>][<a href="https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2">2</a>], and even more experimentally, the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02793">reverse</a>. These hint toward a future in which machines can autonomously process information multi-modally, exchanging text for images or sounds, and vice-versa. These implementations reflect a growing interest of those with more technical backgrounds to apply their research in artistic and design-focused ways.</p><figure data-orig-width="512" data-orig-height="512" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/569a9c7fdf3a1db183d42b7b91389759/tumblr_inline_o2nlv9YJ041ta78fg_540.gif" alt="image" data-orig-width="512" data-orig-height="512"/></figure>

<p>Conversely, those coming from artistic backgrounds have been delving deeper into scientific literature, reading public papers on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arxiv.org</a>, and designing their own deep neural networks using open-source frameworks like <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/">Caffe</a>, <a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a>, <a href="http://torch.ch">Torch</a>, and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, which have dramatically eased the process of getting started. Even higher-level libraries on top of these frameworks have appeared, including <a href="http://keras.io/">Keras</a>, <a href="http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Lasagne</a>, <a href="https://blocks.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Blocks</a>, and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/14/deep-learning-frameworks/">others</a>. The tools of the trade for artists and scientists alike have been converging, blurring the distinctions between them and facilitating new lines of inquiry and cross-disciplinary dialogue.<b><br/></b></p><p>The rise of these powerful tools has precipitated an explosion in public discourse about machine learning. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/">ML subreddit</a>, once a treasure chest of wild speculation, is now rife with students and amateurs asking technical questions and sharing project ideas. Many of the authors of the libraries mentioned above actively maintain blogs where they discuss the latest discoveries, often sharing code for how to reproduce them.</p><p>One researcher, <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/">Andrej Karpathy</a> of <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> and <a href="https://openai.com">OpenAI</a>, even released a Javascript implementation of a convolutional neural network, <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/">convnet.js</a>. One may wonder why, since Javascript&rsquo;s limitations give this library little applicability to scientific research. But that isn&rsquo;t the point. Embedded in a web page, the neural network is instantly accessible: anyone with an internet connection can now interact with an algorithm that has revolutionized computer vision and speech processing.</p><p>As these new methods improve and mature, they will rapidly be applied in contexts that could have significant consequences for society, raising the stakes for their use. This creates more urgency for outreach and education, <a href="https://medium.com/@genekogan/from-pixels-to-paragraphs-eb2763da0e9b">to inform the general public</a> about these multifaceted and counterintuitive technologies. As exciting as they are, they also risk misuse. The example usually cited is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/">how a self-driving car would choose which of two pedestrians to kill</a> if it could only avoid one. Although this scenario is a bit exaggerated, it’s an example of a decision a machine would inevitably have to make. As implementation decisions along the way introduce biases and affect the outcome, the public should have a say in influencing their development.<br/></p><p>Fortunately, the deep learning research community largely conducts research openly, embracing open-review platforms like arxiv and publishing open source software. Additionally, libraries wrapping machine learning functionality into creative coding toolkits like <a href="http://openframeworks.cc">openFrameworks</a> provide an avenue for artists to probe deeper.</p><figure data-orig-width="551" data-orig-height="305" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/0e261a22a3eae842e7561d81578d9312/tumblr_inline_o2nfbdG2w11ta78fg_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="551" data-orig-height="305"/></figure><p><b></b></p>

<p>But the fact that tools are open source does not mean the public understands what those tools entail. Along the journey from initial scientific research and to mass deployment of machine intelligence, artists can help illuminate the gap, providing accessible and engaging cultural metaphors which are more readily understandable than the layers of abstraction in pure research. The machine metaphor has been successful in the past, <a href="https://medium.com/@genekogan/machine-learning-for-artists-e93d20fdb097">helping to popularize computer vision</a> in the context of interactive installations, celebrating its playful side while simultaneously raising caution about its lesser known properties. If present trends continue into the near future, machine intelligence could follow a similar path.<br/></p><p>- Gene Kogan</p>

    Figure 1: Overview of representation learning methods. TLDR; Good representations of data (e.g., text, images) are critical for solving many tasks (e.g., search or recommendations). Deep representation learning yields state of the art results when used to create these representations. In this article, we review methods for representation learning and walk through an example using pretrained models.  Introduction Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become a particularly useful tool in building intelligent systems that simplify cognitive tasks for users.

    Given a question and a passage, the task of Question Answering (QA) focuses on identifying the exact span within the passage that answers the question.
Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    Welcome to the first edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward blog on Natural Language Processing for Question Answering! Throughout this series, we’ll build a Question Answering (QA) system with off-the-shelf algorithms and libraries and blog about our process and what we find along the way. We hope to wind up with a beginning-to-end documentary that provides:

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

  <div class="small">Text classification can be used for sentiment analysis, topic assignment, document identification, article recommendation, and more. While dozens of techniques now exist for this fundamental task, many of them require massive amounts of labeled data in order to be useful. Collecting annotations for your use case is typically one of the most costly parts of any machine learning application. In this report, we explore how latent text embeddings can be used with few (or even zero) training examples and provide insights into best practices for implementing this method.</div>
