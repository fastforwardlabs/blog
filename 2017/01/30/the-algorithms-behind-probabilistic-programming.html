    <h1>The Algorithms Behind Probabilistic Programming</h1>
    <p>We recently <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/01/18/new-research-on-probabilistic-programming.html">introduced our report on probabilistic
programming</a>. The accompanying prototype allows you to explore the <a href="http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/pre/">past and
future of the New York residential real estate
market</a>.</p>
<p>This post gives a feel for the content in our report by introducing the algorithms and technology that make probabilistic programming possible. We&rsquo;ll dive even deeper into these algorithms in conversation with <a href="http://stan.fit/">the Stan Group</a> Tuesday, February 7 at 1 pm ET/10am PT.

<h2 id="bayesian-inference">Bayesian Inference</h2>
<p>Probabilistic programming enables us to construct and fit <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/11/how-bayesian-inference-works.html">probabilistic models</a> in code. At its essence, Bayesian inference is a principled way to draw conclusions from incomplete or
imperfect data, by interpreting data in light of prior knowledge of probabilities. As pretty much all real-world data is incomplete or imperfect in
some way, it&rsquo;s an important (and old!) idea.</p>
<p>Bayesian inference might be the way to go if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>want to make use of institutional knowledge (suspicions, beliefs, logical
certainties) about the quantities you want to measure and predict, rather
than learn solely from the data</li>
<li>have several different datasets that you want to learn from</li>
<li>need to quantify the probability of all possibilities, not just determine
which is most likely</li>
<li>want to do online learning (i.e., continually update your model as data
arrives)</li>
<li>want to do active learning (i.e., gather more information until your
predictions reach some threshold of confidence)</li>
<li>want to use data to decide if a more complicated model is justified</li>
<li>need to explain your decisions to customers or regulators</li>
<li>want to use a single model to answer several questions</li>
<li>have sparse data with a shared or hierarchical structure</li>
</ul>
<p>Many — perhaps most — analytics and product problems are like this. And the
central idea of Bayesian inference is centuries old. Why, then, do relatively few
data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers use the
approach?</p>
<h2 id="the-algorithmic-building-blocks">The Algorithmic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>The problem is that, until recently, the algorithms that make product and business problems
tractable using Bayesian methods have been difficult to implement and computationally
expensive to run. Probabilistic programming systems abstract away many of these difficulties by baking inference algorithms in as building blocks of the language. Morever, these algorithms are robust, so don&rsquo;t require
problem-specific hand-tuning.</p>
<p>One powerful example is sampling from an arbitrary probability distribution, which we need to do often (and efficiently!) when doing inference. The brute force approach, rejection sampling, is problematic because acceptance rates are low: as only a tiny fraction of attempts generate successful samples, the algorithms are slow and inefficient. See <a href="https://jeremykun.com/2015/04/06/markov-chain-monte-carlo-without-all-the-bullshit/">this post by Jeremey Kun</a> for further details.</p>
<p>Until recently, the main alternative to this naive approach was <a href="https://jeremykun.com/2015/04/06/markov-chain-monte-carlo-without-all-the-bullshit/">Markov Chain
Monte Carlo
sampling</a>
(of which <a href="http://michaeljflynn.net/2015/06/01/my-favorite-algorithm-metropolis-hastings/">Metropolis
Hastings</a>
and Gibbs sampling are well-known examples). If you used Bayesian inference in
the 90s or early 2000s, you may remember BUGS (and WinBUGS) or JAGS, which used
these methods. These remain popular teaching tools (see e.g. <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~brewer/stats331.pdf">STATS331 by
Brendon Brewer</a>, our
favorite elementary introduction to Bayesian data analysis). But MCMC samplers
are often too slow for problems with rich structure or internet-scale data.</p>
<p>Bayesian inference research in the last 5-10 years has therefore focused on
two new approaches that use clever ideas to make sure the sampler spends more
time in regions of high probability, raising efficiency. Those are
<strong>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</strong> and <strong>Variational inference</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="hamiltonian-monte-carlo-and-the-no-u-turn-sampler">Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and the No U-Turn Sampler</h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434">Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a> (HMC) treats the
probability distribution as a physical surface. It uses an elegant and
computationally efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics">idea from 19th-century physics</a> to explore that
surface using calculus, as if under the influence of gravity. This method doesn&rsquo;t work
for discrete parameters, but the user doesn&rsquo;t need to differentiate functions by hand.</p>
<p><img src="http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/report_images/ff05/3-06.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To use HMC, you need to tune a sensitive hyperparameter, which makes its
application expensive and error-prone. The invention of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4246">No U-Turn
Sampler</a> (NUTS), a robust algorithm that tunes
this parameter automatically, was crucial for making probabilistic
programming useful and practical.</p>
<h2 id="variational-inference-and-automatic-differentation">Variational Inference and Automatic Differentation</h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00670">Variational inference</a> (VI) samples from a
distribution by building a simple approximation of the distribution. That
approximation is so simple that it can be sampled from directly, entirely
circumventing the need for approximate sampling algorithms like MCMC or HMC.</p>
<p><img src="http://fastforwardlabs.github.io/report_images/ff05/3-08.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To do this, we start with simple distributions that we understand well (e.g.,
Gaussians) and perturb them until they match the real distribution from which
we want to sample. The bulk of this work is done by <a href="http://sebastianruder.com/optimizing-gradient-descent/">stochastic gradient descent (SGD)</a>. Given its widespread use in machine learning (e.g., it&rsquo;s used to train deep neural networks), SGD is well
understood and optimized.</p>
<p>Converting a probabilistic model from a sampling approach to VI used to
require complex math, making it hard for non-experts. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00788">Automatic
Differentiation Variational Inference</a> solves
this problem by using <strong>automatic differentation</strong> (having computers take exact derivatives of arbitrary functions) to differentiate functions
at the CPU instruction level, allowing a probability distribution to be
explored efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="probabilistic-programming-languages">Probabilistic Programming Languages</h2>
<p>ADVI and HMC with NUTS are the two fundamental algorithmic innovations that
have made <strong>probabilistic programming</strong> possible. Their inclusion in leading
probabilistic programming environments (which can be traced back to
<a href="https://goodmorningeconomics.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/the-promise-of-bayesian-statistics-pt-2/">these</a>
<a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2010/11/18/derivative-base/">two</a>
blog posts from 2010) makes inference a one-liner. The end user doesn&rsquo;t need to
tune parameters or differentiate functions by hand. And because they&rsquo;re built
on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or variational inference, they&rsquo;re fast.</p>
<p>But fast and robust algorithms are not all that&rsquo;s required to make Bayesian
inference a practical proposition. Probabilistic programming languages also
make life simpler by providing a concise syntax to define generative
models using a library of built-in probability distributions. Probabilistic
concepts are primitive objects defined in the core language. Specifying the
model is therefore a <em>declarative</em> problem for the user, who declares what is
known to be true and lets the language figure out how to derive conclusions.</p>
<p>The most popular probabilistic programming tools are <a href="http://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a> and
<a href="http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/">PyMC3</a>. <a href="http://edwardlib.org/">Edward</a> is a newcomer gaining
a lot of attention. Stan experts <a href="https://about.me/ericnovik">Eric Novik</a> and <a href="http://syclik.com/">Daniel Lee</a> will walk us through how Stan works and what problems they&rsquo;ve used it to solve in our <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/introduction-to-probabilistic-programming-tickets-31160610224">online event February 7</a>.</p>
<p>For more on PyMC3 see <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/01/11/thomas-wiecki-on-probabilistic-programming-with.html">our interview with Thomas
Wiecki</a>
a PyMC3 core developer (and Director of Data Science at Quantopian). We also
enjoyed <a href="http://stronginference.com/pymc3-release.html">Chris Fonnesbeck&rsquo;s blog
post</a> that accompanied the recent
official release of PyMC3.</p>
<p>In the report we go into more detail on the strengths and weaknesses of these
two languages, and discuss some of the many other options. Whichever language you use, the claim of probabilistic programming - that it
hides the complexity of Bayesian inference - is more true than ever.</p>

    Figure 1: Overview of representation learning methods. TLDR; Good representations of data (e.g., text, images) are critical for solving many tasks (e.g., search or recommendations). Deep representation learning yields state of the art results when used to create these representations. In this article, we review methods for representation learning and walk through an example using pretrained models.  Introduction Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become a particularly useful tool in building intelligent systems that simplify cognitive tasks for users.

    Given a question and a passage, the task of Question Answering (QA) focuses on identifying the exact span within the passage that answers the question.
Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.
