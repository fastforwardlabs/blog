    <h1>Futurism and Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>For some, <a href="http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20607363/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-live-gate-generates-554-million">Mayweather-McGregor</a> was the prizefight of the summer. For others, it has been Musk-Zuckerberg going toe-to-toe over the risks posed by AI, with Musk voicing his <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x">reservations</a> about artificial intelligence while Zuck remains more <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/24/mark-zuckerberg-elon-musks-doomsday-ai-predictions-are-irresponsible.html">sanguine</a>. Musk has called AI possibly the &ldquo;biggest threat&rdquo; to humanity and gone so far as to suggest the decidedly un-Catholic opinion that Silicon Valley should be welcoming regulatory oversight of AI in this one exceptional instance. Some have responded to Musk&rsquo;s statements by accusing him of having watched Terminator a few times too many while others have taken his statements as license to trumpet their own dire warnings about the threat of AI or <a href="http://www.information-age.com/demand-new-legislaai-experts-warning-123468393/">report</a> gleefully over the blow-by-blow.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many of those who have chimed in about the debate have turned to sci-fi for guidance in thinking through the dangers of AI. Rodney Brooks <a href="http://rodneybrooks.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-predicting-the-future-of-ai/">cites</a> Arthur C. Clarke&rsquo;s Adages of Futurism while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/opinion/artificial-intelligence-regulations-rules.html">Oren Etzioni</a> name-checks Asimov&rsquo;s Laws of Robotics before suggesting his own Laws of AI. These are useful, and insightful, approaches to futurism in general, and there are good reasons why we still talk about Clarke and Asimov - their insights remain evergreen. We are hesitant, however, to see warnings about AI, particularly Musk&rsquo;s, as solely prescient warnings about the dangers he perceives. We are also a bit hesitant to describe anyone as playing 11-dimensional chess, but there may be more than meets the eye to Musk&rsquo;s warnings. Consider three possible ulterior motives for sounding the alarm on AI as Musk has:</p>
<p>One - it&rsquo;s great marketing. Marketing on fear, uncertainty, and doubt (<a href="https://www.entrepreneurship.org/articles/2000/10/the-fud-factor-how-to-persuade-customers-to-buy">FUD</a>) is not new, and deploying these emotions around AI is a great way to drive consumers away from competitors, or at the very least towards your own AI research (&hellip;cough&hellip; <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>).</p>
<p>Two - it sets a seat at the table. By calling for regulation of AI now, Musk is positioning himself as someone who has a healthy skepticism of AI, and who can therefore be trusted when he declares regulations to be effective safeguards against the risks he perceives. What better way to be able to shape regulations that go exactly as far as he might want (and no further)?</p>
<p>Three - it&rsquo;s great recruiting. Competition for talented AI researchers and engineers is fierce. This is known. But by calling out the risks of AI as forcefully as he has, Musk may be making a subtle appeal to top-notch researchers who may be on the fence about joining the ranks of larger engineering teams, or vacillating about leaving academia, by signaling the opportunity to work on solving (what seem like) existential challenges for humanity. Not a bad recruiting poster.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/09/star_trek_chess-1505156456055.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So what can we take away from thinking about these possible ulterior motives for the recent spate of dire (if premature and exaggerated) warnings about the risks of AI? One takeaway is a recognition that there <em>are</em> real risks to humans from ML and AI. Building systems that are <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/08/02/interpretability.html">interpretable</a>, that consider aspects of <a href="http://www.fatml.org/">fairness and accountability</a>, and that recognize the potential for harm that today&rsquo;s algorithms possess is not just responsible - it&rsquo;s good design. Building trustworthy systems is also good recruiting and good marketing. Another takeaway is that we should all feel empowered to articulate our own &ldquo;Laws of Robotics,&rdquo; &ldquo;Adages of Futurism,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Laws of AI.&rdquo; This may sound like another principle of sound design (and it is), but it is also a way of thinking through potential risks, as well as opportunities for countering those risks, in ways that are specific to the context of the product being built, or the problem being solved.</p>

    Figure 1: Overview of representation learning methods. TLDR; Good representations of data (e.g., text, images) are critical for solving many tasks (e.g., search or recommendations). Deep representation learning yields state of the art results when used to create these representations. In this article, we review methods for representation learning and walk through an example using pretrained models.  Introduction Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become a particularly useful tool in building intelligent systems that simplify cognitive tasks for users.

    Given a question and a passage, the task of Question Answering (QA) focuses on identifying the exact span within the passage that answers the question.
Figure 1: In this sample, a BERTbase model gets the answer correct (Achaemenid Persia). Model gradients show that the token &ldquo;subordinate ..&rdquo; is impactful in the selection of an answer to the question &ldquo;Macedonia was under the rule of which country?&quot;. This makes sense .. good for BERTbase.

    A deep dive into computing QA predictions and when to tell BERT to zip it! In our last post, Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia, we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we&rsquo;ll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering.

    So you&rsquo;ve decided to build a QA system. You want to start with something simple and general so you plan to make it open domain using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have access to a GPU) so you&rsquo;re going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.

    Welcome to the first edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward blog on Natural Language Processing for Question Answering! Throughout this series, we’ll build a Question Answering (QA) system with off-the-shelf algorithms and libraries and blog about our process and what we find along the way. We hope to wind up with a beginning-to-end documentary that provides:

    At Cloudera Fast Forward, one of the mechanisms we use to tightly couple machine learning research with application is through application development projects for both internal and external clients. The problems we tackle in these projects are wide ranging and cut across various industries; the end goal is a production system that translates data into business impact.
What is Enterprise Grade Machine Learning? Enterprise grade ML, a term mentioned in a paper put forth by Microsoft, refers to ML applications where there is a high level of scrutiny for data handling, model fairness, user privacy, and debuggability.

  <div class="small">Text classification can be used for sentiment analysis, topic assignment, document identification, article recommendation, and more. While dozens of techniques now exist for this fundamental task, many of them require massive amounts of labeled data in order to be useful. Collecting annotations for your use case is typically one of the most costly parts of any machine learning application. In this report, we explore how latent text embeddings can be used with few (or even zero) training examples and provide insights into best practices for implementing this method.</div>

  <div class="small">In contrast to how humans learn, deep learning algorithms need vast amounts of data and compute and may yet struggle to generalize. Humans are successful in adapting quickly because they leverage their knowledge acquired from prior experience when faced with new problems. In this report, we explain how meta-learning can leverage previous knowledge acquired from data to solve novel tasks quickly and more efficiently during test time</div>
