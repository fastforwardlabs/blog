<p>On September 6, we will host a <a href="https://mlinterpretability.splashthat.com/">public webinar on interpretability</a> where we&rsquo;ll be joined by guests Patrick Hall (Senior Director for Data Science Products at H2o.ai, co-author of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ideas-on-interpreting-machine-learning">Ideas on Interpreting Machine Learning</a>) and Sameer Singh (Assistant Professor of Computer Science at UC Irvine, co-creator of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME</a>). There will be lots of opportunities for the audience to ask questions, so we hope you&rsquo;ll <a href="https://mlinterpretability.splashthat.com/">join us</a>!</p>
<p>During our research, we built an interpretability prototype called <em>Refractor</em> to better understand the reasons why a subscription business loses customers. This prototype depends on <em>Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations</em> (LIME), a new algorithm and open source tool for interpreting the behavior of machine learning models that was released last year (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">paper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/marcotcr/lime">code</a>).</p>
<p>We discuss LIME in depth in our report, but in this article, we take look at it from a conceptual perspective and apply LIME to a binary classification problem: predicting whether couples stay together, or not.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-need-interpretability-especially-now">Why we need interpretability, especially now</h2>
<p>Algorithms decide which emails reach our inboxes, whether we are approved for credit, and whom we get the opportunity to date. But, as algorithms give answers, they raise questions. If an algorithm denies your loan application, wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know why or what you could change for a more positive outcome? Or perhaps you&rsquo;d like to know if your bank is right to trust the algorithm in the first place.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, machine learning algorithms learn relationships between inputs and outputs. During model training, we supply examples of these inputs and outputs as &ldquo;learning material&rdquo; and the algorithm learns the relationship, a parametrized function or trained model. It uses this model to provide outputs for novel inputs.</p>
<p>Some relationships are simple and can be captured by simple, linear models, which are easy to inspect and understand. For example, the probability of loan default increases with loan amount and decreases with income. These models are interpretable, meaning, they allow a qualitative understanding between inputs and outputs.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/08/2_11-1504010664139.png" alt="loan default"></p>
<h5 id="the-simple-linear-relationship-between-income-loan-amount-and-loan-default">The simple, linear relationship between income, loan amount, and loan default.</h5>
<p>But some relationships are complex. A customer&rsquo;s decisions to cancel a subscription, the focus of our <em>Refractor</em> prototype, or the long-term success of a romantic relationship may depend on multiple factors in non-linear ways. To accurately model these relationships we need models with the flexibility to capture that complexity. Models such as random forests, gradient boosted trees, and neural networks can do just that. But, these complex models are intrinsically difficult to inspect, understand and interpret.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/08/2_15-1504010918343.png" alt="complex decision surface"></p>
<h5 id="complex-non-linear-relationships-as-shown-in-this-figure-cannot-be-captured-by-simple-models-models-that-can-capture-this-complexity-tend-to-be-less-interpretable">Complex, non-linear relationships, as shown in this figure, cannot be captured by simple models. Models that can capture this complexity tend to be less interpretable.</h5>
<h2 id="the-promise-of-interpretability-for-practitioners">The promise of interpretability for practitioners</h2>
<p>Interpretability means we can understand the reasons why an algorithm gave a particular response. In a recent <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/08/02/business-interpretability.html">blog post</a> we cover why, from a business perspective, one should care about interpretability.</p>
<p>But data scientists and machine learning <em>practitioners</em> benefit from interpretability, too. Interpretability ensures that a model is <em>right</em> for the right reasons and <em>wrong</em> for the right reasons, which traditional measures of model performance, such as model accuracy on the hold-out test set, cannot capture. Insights into the model can help improve it and can help build trust that the model, once deployed, will continue to do a good job.</p>
<p>One approach to ensure interpretability is to use simple models, but the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy means that, if relationships between inputs and outputs are complex, accuracy will suffer.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/08/2_16-1504056142850.png" alt="accuracy vs. interpretability"></p>
<h5 id="more-accurate-models-tend-to-be-harder-to-inspect-and-understand">More accurate models tend to be harder to inspect and understand.</h5>
<p>Another option is to use &ldquo;white-box&rdquo; models. These have been developed specifically to provide insight into their internal workings without sacrificing model accuracy <em>too much</em>. We cover white-box models in our <a href="http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/08/02/interpretability.html">report</a>.</p>
<h2 id="model-agnostic-interpretability-and-lime">Model-agnostic interpretability and LIME</h2>
<p>But what if you don&rsquo;t want to (or can&rsquo;t) change your model? Perhaps there&rsquo;s no other way to get the accuracy you need. Perhaps it&rsquo;s already in production. Or perhaps you didn&rsquo;t make it and have no idea how it works. In these situation, &ldquo;model-agnostic&rdquo; interpretability tools such as LIME may be the right approach (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">paper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/marcotcr/lime">code</a>). LIME is based on two simple ideas: perturbation and locally linear approximation.</p>
<h4 id="perturbation">Perturbation</h4>
<p>Perturbation is probably exactly what you would do if you were asked to explore a black-box model. By repeatedly perturbing the input and observing its effect on the output you can develop an understanding of how different inputs relate to the original output.</p>
<p>LIME formalizes this idea. It takes a prediction you want to explain and systematically perturbs its inputs. These perturbed inputs become new, labelled training data for a simpler approximate model.</p>
<h4 id="locally-linear-approximation">Locally linear approximation</h4>
<p>LIME fits a linear model to describe the relationships between the (perturbed) inputs and outputs. In doing so, it weights generated labels close to the example more heavily to nudge the algorithm to focus on the most relevant part of the &ldquo;decision function&rdquo;. So, the simple linear algorithm approximates the more complex, non-linear function learned by the high-accuracy model <em>locally</em>, in the vicinity of the to-be-explained prediction.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/08/3_07-1504056507453.png" alt="locally linear approximation"></p>
<h5 id="even-complex-decision-functions-can-be-approximated-_locally_-by-simple-linear-models">Even complex decision functions can be approximated <em>locally</em> by simple linear models.</h5>
<p>Based on two simple ideas, LIME is an exciting breakthrough. It allows you to train a model in <em>any way you like</em> and still have an answer to the local question, &ldquo;Why has this particular decision been made?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="putting-lime-to-work-explaining-the-predicted-fate-of-romantic-relationships">Putting LIME to work, explaining the (predicted) fate of romantic relationships</h2>
<p>Love endures forever but when it doesn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know why? We took the Stanford <a href="https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst">HCMST data</a> (How Couples Meet and Stay Together), a longitudinal study on how American&rsquo;s meet their partners, and build a classifier to predict whether (and why) couples are likely to stay together.</p>
<p>We modeled the relationship between couples and their relationship fate using a random forest classifier, a widely used ensemble model that is difficult to inspect and understand. Popular machine learning libraries offer simple ways to implement machine learning routines. We used <code>sklearn</code>'s&rsquo; <code>RandomForestClassifier</code> for model training, <code>GridSearchCV</code> for hyperparameter tuning, and <code>Pipeline</code> to streamline data preprocessing. If you want to see the code, and experiment with LIME, you can access the notebook <a href="https://github.com/fastforwardlabs/couples-lime/blob/master/couples-lime.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
<p>To explain predictions, once we had a trained model, we needed to instantiate the <code>LimeTabularExplainer</code> object. It takes as inputs a list of feature names (<code>feature_names</code>) and class names (<code>class_names</code>), a list of all categorical variables (<code>categorical_features</code>) and a dictionary of the values of all categorical variables (<code>categorical_names</code>) in addition to the training data; LIME perturbs inputs according to the training data distribution.</p>

Why the trouble, you may wonder? We could supply scaled, one-hot encoded example input to the <code>explain_instance</code> method?</p>
<p>To explain predictions, we need to be able to <em>understand</em> the reasons returned by solutions like LIME. If LIME returned a sequence of numbers that, mathematically speaking, is a good explanation for a prediction, we would be none the wiser. Explanations needs to be given in a language and at the scale the we can understand; that&rsquo;s why we need to bother with <code>Pipeline</code>.</p>
<h3 id="why-relationships-are-predicted-to-fail">Why relationships (are predicted to) fail</h3>
<p>According to the model, across couples based on random forest&rsquo;s feature importances only, your age, your partner&rsquo;s age, and the difference in age between partners determines whether couples are going to stay together, or not. LIME shows that the reasons for likely relationship success vary from one couple to the next.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/09/lime_3-1504282789410.png" alt=""></p>

LIME informs us that the prediction is due to the fact that the couple is married while their (young) age lowers their chances of relationship &ldquo;success&rdquo;.</h5>
<p><img src="/images/2017/09/lime_13-1504299937445.png" alt=""></p>

LIME informs us the prediction is due to the fact that the couple owns their home, they are matched in terms of the level of education, and the respondent is between 43 and 55 years. Curiously, living in an urban area and voting democrat is associated with a lower chance to staying together.</h5>
<p>LIME captures nuances above feature importances, the variables the trained model deems important globally, across the entire data encountered during training (age, partner&rsquo;s age, age difference). LIME focuses on individuals, not global patterns.</p>
<h2 id="what-lime-reasons-are-not-good-for">What LIME reasons are not (good for)</h2>
<p>How about using algorithms to manage your love life strategically? The model suggests to look for a partner close in age. Should you ask for a pay increase, buy a house, or get married? We asked LIME.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/09/pre_marriage_lime-1504283413457.png" alt=""></p>
<h5 id="your-chances-of-staying-together-arent-bad-the-model-gives-is-a-079-but-merely-living-together-is-hurting-your-chances-according-to-lime">Your chances of staying together aren&rsquo;t bad, the model gives is a 0.79. But merely &ldquo;living together&rdquo; is hurting your chances, according to LIME.</h5>
<p>Evaluating different options, getting married leads to the biggest increase in your chance of staying together. But, we advice <em>against</em> marrying tonight&rsquo;s Tinder date. It may be tempting to treat LIME&rsquo;s reasons as <em>causes</em> of the real-world phenomena the model is predicting; surely, a high amount of debt on my loan application is the reason (read &ldquo;cause&rdquo;) for my denied loan application (especially if a smaller debt amount would have changed the outcome).</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/09/post_marriage_lime-1504283506173.png" alt=""></p>
<h5 id="getting-married-increases-your-chance-of-staying-together-to-091-but-reasons-are-not-causes-we-advice-against-marrying-tonights-tinder-date">Getting married increases your chance of staying together to 0.91. But, reasons are not causes. We advice against marrying tonight&rsquo;s Tinder date.</h5>
<p>Algorithmic relationship advice should be taken with a grain of salt, LIME reasons are not causes. Interpretability helps us understand the inner workings of models to improve these models, to help build trust in models, and to form hypotheses about phenomena in the real-world captured by models (that warrant rigorous tests).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, LIME picks up on patterns in the data learned by the model, it does not inform about reality. Data reflects current and past conventions and social practices (which we see in our results). LIME is no oracle, but it allows humans to enter a more collaborative relationship with black-box machine learning models, and question them when necessary.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/08/02/business-interpretability.html">we&rsquo;ve said before</a>: &ldquo;The future is algorithmic. White-box models and techniques for making black-box models interpretable offer a safer, more productive, and ultimately more collaborative relationship between humans and intelligent machines. We are just at the beginning of the conversation about interpretability and will see the impact over the coming years.&rdquo;</p>

    Video makes up a significant portion of all data in the world. The 30 thousand hours of video uploaded to Youtube every hour is part of that data. Another chunk is produced by the 770 million surveillance cameras globally. But in addition to being plentiful, video data has tremendous capacity to store useful information. Its vastness, richness, and applicability makes the understanding of video a key activity within the field of computer vision.

    Automatic summarization is a task in which a machine distills a large amount of data into a subset (the summary) that retains the most relevant and important information from the whole. While traditionally applied to text, automatic summarization can include other formats such as images or audio. In this article we’ll cover the main approaches to automatic text summarization, talk about what makes for a good summary, and introduce Summarize. &ndash; a summarization prototype we built that showcases several automatic summarization techniques.

    In extractive summarization, the task is to identify a subset of text (e.g., sentences) from a document that can then be assembled into a summary. Overall, we can treat extractive summarization as a recommendation problem. That is, given a query, recommend a set of sentences that are relevant. The query here is the document, relevance is a measure of whether a given sentence belongs in the document summary.
How we go about obtaining this measure of relevance varies (a common dilemma for any recommendation system).

    The Gensim library is a staple of the NLP stack. While it primarily focuses on topic modeling and similarity for documents, it also supports several word embedding algorithms, including what is likely the best-known implementation of Word2Vec.
Word embedding models like Word2Vec use unlabeled data to learn vector representations for each token in a corpus. These embeddings can then be used as features in myriad downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or recommendation systems.

The machine learning life cycle is more than data + model = API. We know there is a wealth of subtlety and finesse involved in data cleaning and feature engineering. In the same vein, there is more to model-building than feeding data in and reading off a prediction. ML model building requires thoughtfulness both in terms of which metric to optimize for a given problem, and how best to optimize your model for that metric!

  <div class="small">Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of a target domain change overtime causing model performance to degrade. Drift detection is generally achieved by monitoring a performance metric of interest and triggering a retraining pipeline when that metric falls below some designated threshold. However, this approach assumes ample labeled data is available at prediction time - an unrealistic constraint for many production systems. In this report, we explore various approaches for dealing with concept drift when labeled data is not readily accessible.</div>

  <div class="small">Being able to recommend an item of interest to a user (based on their past preferences) is a highly relevant problem in practice. A key trend over the past few years has been session-based recommendation algorithms that provide recommendations solely based on a user’s interactions in an ongoing session, and which do not require the existence of user profiles or their entire historical preferences. This report explores a simple, yet powerful, NLP-based approach (word2vec) to recommend a next item to a user. While NLP-based approaches are generally employed for linguistic tasks, here we exploit them to learn the structure induced by a user’s behavior or an item’s nature.</div>

  <div class="small">Text classification can be used for sentiment analysis, topic assignment, document identification, article recommendation, and more. While dozens of techniques now exist for this fundamental task, many of them require massive amounts of labeled data in order to be useful. Collecting annotations for your use case is typically one of the most costly parts of any machine learning application. In this report, we explore how latent text embeddings can be used with few (or even zero) training examples and provide insights into best practices for implementing this method.</div>
